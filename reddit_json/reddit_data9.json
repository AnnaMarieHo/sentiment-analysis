            "body": "i've told this story  before so Ill just copy and paste .\n\nMy boyfriend at the time and I were house  sitting for his uncle.  My boyfriend was at work and I was bathing our son before bed. I had the bathroom window (facing the backyard) very slightly cracked, and heard a cough from outside. This house was in a residential neighborhood so it could have been a neighbor, but I suddenly felt anxious and scared and something told me to go make sure the back door was locked. I left my two year old son alone in a towel in the bathroom and ran to the back door. As i placed my hand on the doorknob locking it, I came face to face with someone through the glass, who had his hand on the outside doorknob. He started pounding on the door and jiggling the doorknob saying he was looking for someone and i just told him no, they're not here. he kept jiggling the doorknob and i ran to my son and grabbed my cell phone to call for help. Remember Im house sitting tho, and this was in 2004/2005 when they had those flip open phones, not a smart phone where you can just look at a map. So i had no idea what the address was, or where the house phone was.  Anyways, i call 911 from the bathroom on my cell, while hearing loud pounding on the back door. The dispatchers tells me to find a house phone, piece of mail anything with address. I locate the house phone and call 911 from that. so have no idea how police got there so quickly, but just as I hear the back door glass break, the guy on the phone tells me to cover my sons head with a blanket and run out the front door into the backseat of the police car . I ran out the front door and saw 6 or more police cars all with guns drawn and straight into the waiting cruiser.\n\nAfter they arrested the guy, they ask me if the machete on the back porch belonged to the owners of the house. The guy had a machete and had I not trusted my gut that the cough sounded a little to close, and to check the back door, he would've walked right into an unlocked house to a 19 year old female and her young son alone.\n\nTurns out he had been robbing houses and had a backpack full of stolen things, and was high on meth.\n\nAnyways, super glad so followed my gut on that one.",

We were walking back to the car and had just left the main street to walk to the parking lot when I just got this sudden panic feeling and stopped dead in my tracks and started looking around. My gf was like \"What? What's wrong?\" I said, \"I don't know, but I feel like we need to go back for a few minutes until more people are around.\" So we went back and waited for more people who were walking our direction, but actually a cop car that patrolled the area showed up and I walked over asked him \"Can you watch us walk to my car, it's just right over there, I just feel like there's someone waiting for us to be alone.\" We walked to the car and man with a hoodie and a gun jumped out and demanded our valuables...the cop immediately turned on his lights and siren and his tires started squealing as he sped over, the dude of course immediately bolted. The cops chased after him, I have no idea if they caught him, but had I not had that unexplainable fear and instinct, we would have been robbed, maybe even shot. I still can't explain how I knew because I didn't see anyone, I just felt in danger.",

One of the things they do in Rio for New Year's is taking party boats out in the bay and watching the fireworks show that they shoot off from the beach. My great aunt and uncle bought us all tickets for one of the boats. When we got there, she took one look at the boat and refused to get on it. Ended up eating the cost of the tickets and buying us tickets last minute for another boat. It cost her a small fortune and we all thought she was nuts. \n\nThe boat we were supposed to be on eventually ended up overloaded with passengers, but it wasn't like that when we got there. The water was choppy that night and it capsized at about 11:45. Dozens of people on it drowned, including a famous Brazilian actress and most of the children on the boat. The phone at my great aunt's apartment started ringing at 6 AM from people who heard the news and were making sure we weren't on that boat. We had no idea what had happened until that first phone call. After she got off the phone, which had woken us all up, she looked like she'd seen a ghost.",

I got such a bad feeling about it and was like \"dude, you're gonna get hurt\" but he was adamant that he would be fine. When he started rolling down the ramp, the weight distribution of him being inside caused the spool to veer off course right towards a grind rail that protruded out from the supports (imagine it like a pi symbol). I dropped my phone and started sprinting towards the spool to jump in front to try and stop him. The spool totally wrecked me and I fell over and hurt my wrist, but I did slow the spool down significantly before it hit the rail. That metal rail tore straight through the wood and hit my friend in the stomach with enough force to leave a bruise. If I hadn't jumped in front of the spool to slow it down and it hit that rail at full speed, my friend would have 100% been impaled. So yeah...Nick, if you're reading this... you owe me your life and I hope my sons aren't as dumb as we were when they're teenagers.",

He had a grand mal (tonic clonic) seizure and his heart stopped. I was the only one who actually knew CPR (OR scrub tech) and got him to come around after about 30 seconds. I rushed him to the hospital and they performed an emergency craniotomy to remove a bleeding angioma. He made a full recovery. That was 15 years ago and he is perfectly normal now (on anti convulsants). No one told me he was at my dad's.  He didn't even spend a lot of time there, I just absolutely KNEW that's where he was. There was no question. I just knew he was there and he NEEDED me. I do not ignore my gut. I don't think anyone would have believed me if I hadn't had witnesses. I literally showed up and saved the day, and his life! I was always closer to him than my other siblings. Intuition exists for a reason!",

His wife never minded him often spending time with young guys who \"needed a positive male role model\" instead of their own kids.

We had fun, but I had this gut feeling that he shouldn't know too much about me. \n\nSo anyhow, I found recently that he did 4 years for production and possession of child porn and sexual abuse of children. I knew some of the girls and boys he used. Multiple parents trusted him for years. I used to have a crush on one of the girls he filmed. He recruited the kids bit by bit, he got to know one and got to know their friends and so on. I was in his informal recruitment network, I was driven around in his recruitment truck, I went out to his hunt camp where stuff happened. \n\nBut my gut isn't always right. One of the most positive, influential role models of my 20s turned out to have a thing with offering sex lessons to teen girls. I had no idea.",

            "body": "When I was 10 years old, my dad was burning leaves along our elevated driveway. I felt sick to my stomach all day but knew I wasn’t sick. We left to go to a birthday party at the ymca shortly after and I kept having panic attacks and kept telling my little sister something was wrong at the house. My dad kept getting angry every time I said something about it. I couldn’t play, I couldn’t eat cake, I couldn’t do anything. \n\nAt the end of the party we got a call that our house was engulfed in flames. We lived in the Ozarks and you could see the house at the top of one of the hills just burning to high heavens as you went down the highway to get to the neighborhood entrance. My dad laughed and was like “my house is on fire again” (we had 3 previous incidents, one was a lightning strike, one was a field fire that got our porch from our neighbors pasture, and the other was my fault from knocking a candle over, obviously all got put out fairly quickly). \n\nThe house was a total loss. Luckily my parents were divorced and most of our stuff was at moms, but all of our childhood photos and memories were at that house. \n\nAnyway turns out it was arson and my dad wanted a pool. He was not a good person. I was reading his body language and behaviors and knew something was wrong but couldn’t figure it out.\n\nEdit: this got more attention than I thought it would but I figured I’d clarify some things and include some photos.  \n\nOur elevated driveway that he was burning leaves against led to a latticed gate underneath our front porch that housed the lawn mower and the gas tanks. The FD deemed it reasonable that he just didn’t put the fire out completely and it crept into the gated area under the porch. \n\nHe was a firebug with a pyro license. He had tried insurance fraud before when he was younger by burning down an old barn with one of his cars inside, but nothing came of it AFAIK. I was not alive then and don’t speak to what’s left of his side of the family, nor do I care enough to ask. \n\nWe lived on top of a “mountain” (also see, a glorified big ass hill) and our OG contractor built it on a high foundation so that it could be seen all majestic and shit from the highway. My dad hated the exposed foundation from the get go. Part of it being seen from the mountain was that we had a “grand staircase” that never got used, and that’s where the pool went. \n\n[anyway, here are photos of the house.](https://imgur.com/a/EZqjDaR) I don’t have any from before, as they all burned in the fire, and my relationship with him very quickly deteriorated after the new house rebuilt so I don’t have any pictures of the after besides a few on the inside. \n\nI wish I was making all of this up, but my whole life feels like a fever dream. The more lore I drop, the more people think I’m lying. I wish I was lying and I wish I didn’t have so many “stories” to tell. I made my therapist cry telling him about the hell that was my childhood when the stories kept coming.\n\nEdit 2: fixed typos",

A family friend reached out to ask if I could move back my flight a few days to stay with him in the city and meet some coworkers of his in the office the next day -- he worked in the South Tower.  My parents were all about me going as they thought it was a great opportunity for me to network, and they loved that I was getting time with their best friends' kid who was very much a small-town-made-good story.  By any indication, it was a great opportunity and should have been a fun experience.\n\nI recall leaving my hotel to the airport with a real sense of foreboading at the time, way beyond worrying about paying to change the flight showing up late to pick up the keys in Paris to my apartment.  It was a raw gut feeling of I've only felt a few times in my life e.g. when I knew I was in phyical danger, someone had broken into my house at night while I was in bed etc. Only in this instance, I had no rational explanation for feeling that way.  I forwarded apologies to our family friend making some excuses that I needed to meet with professors prior to classes starting, and I caught my flight.  Best decision I ever made (unknowingly, but had a strange precience about).  It still have no idea why I had that ominous feeling.\n\nOn a happy note, my friend got out ok and is doing fine.",

The vast majority of the time the interactions are healthy, fun, and uplifting.\n\nBut similar to other trust-based arts (yoga, swing dance, etc., even kink), every once in a while a bad actor will come along, whose intent is to use the practice to manipulate women and sometimes assault them.\n\nRecently a new guy moved to town who immediately set off my Spidey Sense as a potential danger. He began instantly acting like a bigger deal locally than he was, super vocal in all the group chats, made no attempt to learn the tone of the local group before leaping in with both feet. Sort of like that guy in your freshman dorm who instantly declares himself the ringleader: \"Say, fellas, who's up for some bowling tonight?\" while everyone else side-eyes each other, like \"Who is this guy, exactly?\"\n\nWhat I've realized after several instances of helping deal with community predators is that they tend to have a pattern of being booted out of previous, similar groups. They never learn their lesson; instead, they're totally the victim, and they immediately pop up in another group, or maybe the same type of group, just in a different town.\n\nAnyway, the vibe I got off this new guy said to me that this is someone who's been kicked out of one community, and wants to near-instantly regain equal stature in another, so he can resume his tricks. In groups like this, reputation is everything, and that can only be earned with time and consistent respectful behavior. In short, beware anyone trying to cut the line.\n\nSure enough, within a couple months, someone at one of our meet-ups saw this guy on the sidelines and let us know he was in the process of being removed from a local dance group due to stalker-y behavior toward women. I'm betting there's a trail of other communities before that've asked him to leave, too.",

I sprained my ankle, got a huge bruise on my leg, bloody nose, and a concussion. The sheriff told me he was shocked I was still alive. My car was totaled. My engine was no longer in my car. When my mom arrived, she was horrified and felt terrible that she wasn't nicer. \n\nSadly, the man only got a hit and run and not a DUI. He was in his forties and had done this before.

I did not change my vote.\n\n9 months later, our association was in a crisis. Large sums of money had gone missing, but we couldn't prove how, so couldn't report the issue to the police. But at our extraordinary assembly, we all agreed to boot members from the steering committee we couldn't trust, including the non-resident leader (who had ultimate responsibility). It was then decided that he was also not to get his extra financial compensation. I remember one neighbor glanced over at me at that moment, wondering how I knew.",

I just kept it to myself and told a few close friends. \n\nOne night in 2019 me and my ex boyfriend are finishing work really late, went to get food and get into a taxi to go home. We are both in the back seat. After just a minute or two I got this really weird feeling that I still to this day can’t really explain. I felt both anxious and really at home at the same time. And suddenly I get the urge to look for the name tag of the driver on the dash and was like “what if that’s him”. But there was no name tag. The driver had long hair, some weird white contact lenses and he was blasting some deep shit industrial music, it was a memorable taxi driver. We get off, we joked about the lenses, got home and forgot about it.\n\nIn 2021 my dad suddenly passed away and police was briefly involved. Turns out they called my half brother first, then they called me and my mom. So the next day he reached out to me, we meet, we talk, and guess what? He starts telling me how he was a taxi driver but he had recently quit that job. And as he’s telling me that and I look at him I immediately remembered about that ride and started describing everything from that ride and he was like “Yes, that was me” \n\nTo this day I am still blow away how intense that feeling was and it was right! Went to therapy about it, it really fucked me up and the loss of my dad. Turns out me and brother live close by, we keep in touch and still getting to know each other.",

Destination city somewhere like Omaha. I looked at the manifest and it said they were traveling together but didn’t have the last name. I tried to casually engage but the little boy spoke zero English and the man was not interested in communicating at all..he was American tho. \nI just knew that I knew that I knew that I had stumbled upon something bad. I asked the other crew members to walk by that area to see if anyone else picked up on it. They ALL DID!\nNotified capt who then notified authorities in dest city. I am telling you that entire jetbridge was filled with local and federal officials, fbi, cops….you name it. Man knew he was toast and the reasons he was giving for having the boy in his custody just weren’t tracking. Turns out the man had essentially bought the boy from his dirt poor family. I’ll let you figure out the reason why he was bringing him here. This was long before sex trafficking was even heard about even tho it has always been a thing. Boy was spared and sent back home to his country and man was arrested. Upon going thru his bags it was obvious what his intent was and the boy had most likely already been victimized before comjng back to the states.  I cry and get so sick to my stomach every time I think of the terror on that boys face and the creep factor I was getting from his abuser. \nThe very worst that could have happened is I could have been wrong and they could have been inconvenienced by a delay getting to baggage claim. I would 1000% rather be wrong than living a lifetime of feeling like I didn’t do the right thing.",

A few minutes later, I was sitting back in the living room, and the dog was at his dish by the back door. I could see the dog from where I was sitting but not the door. Suddenly, the dog stopped eating and started staring at the door. Then he started growling really low. Then I heard the back door being yanked open and the chain lock catching. The dog started going nuts barking at the door, and I ran upstairs and woke my older brother up. I told him what happened, and he went out with a baseball bat, but nobody was there. \n\nI assume the dog scared them away, but I always wonder what would have happened if I didn't get that gut feeling to put the lock up.",

So I tried to snag a few hours rest (obviously couldn't actually fall asleep), between bouts of crying and calming, before going back and switching out with my bros.\n\nLess than an hour in, outta nowhere, I suddenly had this ***absolutely crushing, churning pressure/feeling*** in the core of my body, but wasn't really anywhere I could pinpoint (like nothing I've ever felt before and hope not to feel again). \n\nAnd then it was suddenly gone and replace by sheer unadulterated **dread** (which I have felt before but also don't wanna feel again, lol). So I get outta bed and start getting ready to head to the hospital. \n\nI call my bro to let him know I was coming back, and he said, \"did they call you? I was about to call you. Dad's gone. I'm sorry, he's gone. His heart stopped and they tried to bring him back but they couldn't this time.\"\n\nI had a notion in that moment, but I confirmed a few hours later (when the rest of the family was all together at bro's house) that the crushing pressure thing was at the exact time my Dad died.",

It just doesn’t feel right.” He took me to my parents’ house 30 miles away. \n\nWe hung out with my parents and hours later got a call from the police that my boyfriend needed to come give a statement because there had been a shooting at his apartment. When we got there, the whole complex was taped off and we had to give statements of where we were. \n\nApparently, after I took off on foot and my boyfriend left to go find me, his brother came over and invited a bunch of people. Some fight happened and someone had a gun and shot up the apartment. No one was injured thankfully but there was a bullet hole through the wall right above my boyfriend’s bed. Right where our heads would have been if we had been there watching a movie.\n\nThis was almost 20 years ago now and I still have no idea why I wanted to get out of there so bad that I literally just took off on foot with nowhere to go.",

She argued it would take a lot to sell because we'd have to list before October and there was a lot of work . . . \n\nI agreed with all of her points, but I wanted out.  I felt like an animal trapped in a cage.  \n\nRight after we agreed to put the house up, I broke my foot. Had to fly to China for business.  But I pushed. We hired a handyman to fix everything. Threw money at.  My wife was pushing back, but I was absolutely sure I wanted to move.\n\nThree more trips to Asia, one on Thanksgiving week, and we still pressed on.  I had to sign a power of attorney to my wife so she could sign at the closing.  These were all things I would normally see as roadblocks that would make me rethink things.  But this time, I had a hunch.  I actually thought the housing market would drop out again. That was how I rationalized it.\n\nSo, in January of 2020, we moved into a lovely sprawling raised ranch in exurban Connecticut.  It had newer applicances, an acre of land, a long and wide floorplan that made it feel like different wings.  We gained an extra bedroom for houseguests, a downstairs den, and fewer stairs.\n\nThat was where we spent lockdown.  With my mother, who had to move in because where she lived was overwhelmed and she was a heart patient and couldn't walk stairs easily.  We had a lot of space for the humans and the dogs and we could stay in the same house without feeling on top of each other.  We wouldn't have survived in our prior house.",

I must have said it with such force that everyone did so and once we got upstairs we found the place completely trashed (tv pulled off the wall and in pieces on the ground, smashed windows, etc) and the big knives were missing from the knife block and there were massive slits in the couches and other stuff. That's when we heard footsteps and voices downstairs - THEY WERE STILL IN THE HOUSE. We locked ourselves on the balcony and called the cops and they came pretty quick so we were fine, but can't imagine what could have happened if we'd gone into the downstairs rooms and come across a group of men with butchers knives",

Suddenly my colleague asked me to dance, I got up and was trying out the dance. In that time, I saw this friend walk past my side of the table, so briefly I lost sight of my drink. It was seemingly innocent but gave me a horrible feeling. I decided not to have another sip of my drink. We finished the dance and just held on the glass.

I got nervous all of a sudden, when I was just fine before. Then shook it off, thought “You don’t put that on me, Ricky Bobby!” and commenced cutting. No sooner had he reached the top step when my hand slipped and I cleanly sliced half the tip of my pointer finger off. I just stared at it in shock. Bound it tight and fast and took off upstairs with my hand held up in the air, all the while hollering “YEP! Yep! Yeah, YOU CALLED IT! Holy shit, son!” Lol.

I’ve been drinking and met up with my friend who was my DD.  She parked in the parking garage  at the casino where we were at.  We get to the elevator, just her and I; and a guy holds the door and comes in. Doesn’t say anything just keeps his head down. We think nothing of it so we go about our conversation about our dinner  we had and the club we went to.   We get out into the parking garage, the guy walks ahead of us and stops and goes behind a pillar in the garage. I look to my right and see another guy just standing there; but not standing waiting for someone.  Just standing randomly like he’s waiting to move on someone.  I look at my friend and I say something random like “ hey I know my husband is waiting in the car but I really need to use the bathroom first”.  She then replies with, “ I figured you’d need to go after drinking all that water to sober up”.   So we get on the elevator and go to the floor that is right by the front lobby of the casino.  I asked her and said, did you have a weird feeling? She said yes that’s why I made that comment”. So We see a security guard and ask if they can walk us back to our car.  They do, and when we come back up and have the security guard walk us, the two men who were acting like they didn’t know each other then  acted like they knew each other and talked about gambling.   That night I realized what intuition was. Idk what would have happened the night if I just walked casually to my friends car, probably robbed or something else, but my god the feeling I had in my gut is something I never had before in my life and I am so happy my friend and I felt the same thing.",

Several years later, I was saddened to see in the local paper that Bill was killed in a car crash near his home, leaving Amy a widow with a young child.\n\nA few years after that I moved to another nearby town, and my driving route to work would take me through the intersection where Bill had his fatal accident. I'd always think about him when I drove through it. One day, I was waiting at a red light to proceed through the intersection. The light turned green, but I had this nagging feeling that I should just wait a bit before proceeding, so I did. Sure enough, a tan Volvo (I still remember the car, clearly) came barreling through the intersection from the other direction, not even slowing down for the red light. Had I gone right when the light turned, there is no question that the Volvo would have t-boned me, hard. \n\nWas it Bill intervening, dumb luck, something else? I'll never know but I'm just glad I'm here to tell the tale.",

            "body": "Two years ago, I couldn’t shake this strange, nagging feeling—like something bad was about to happen. I was a healthy, active young woman, never hospitalized before, but I kept having this weird premonition that I was going to get seriously ill. I even joked with my family, half-laughing, half-serious, that I thought I was going to end up in the hospital soon. I had this bizarre hunch it would be something rare and dramatic—like Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. I knew how irrational it sounded, how statistically unlikely it was, but the thought just kept popping into my head… for weeks.\n\nThen one day, it started. Just a headache—persistent and dull, nothing too wild. I had gone for a run that day, vacuumed the whole house, so I figured I’d just overdone it. I took Tylenol, then Motrin. I drank caffeine. Nothing touched it. The next morning, I had a low-grade fever. \n\nBut the headache kept getting worse—exponentially worse. It became the most excruciating pain I’d ever experienced. I developed severe back pain, and the fever spiked to 105°F. Then things turned scary—I started losing control of my movements, stumbling and dropping things, unable to walk normally. My mind got fuzzy. I was confused and not making sense. Something was very wrong.\n\nI went to the emergency room—three times. The first two times, they said it was “just the flu.” I tried to believe them, but deep down, I knew they were wrong. By the third visit, I was barely functioning. I called my dad and left him a voicemail I barely remember, telling him I was dying.\n\nThe last time, they finally admitted me to the hospital. I was diagnosed with severe sepsis and bacterial meningitis. No one thought I’d survive. I spent nearly a month in the hospital. My liver went into failure for reasons they couldn’t explain. Once I was discharged, the fevers and headache came back. I ended up in the hospital again and was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease rare for someone my age. \n\nThe whole experience cracked open my reality. I was a healthy young woman—until I wasn’t. And now I carry the weight of that trauma with me every day. My health hasn’t been the same since unfortunately and I have pretty bad health anxiety now, to say the least.",

Obviously that wasn’t actually applicable in this situation as that statistic makes sense because 5 miles from the home is going to be your most highly trafficked area. Still couldn’t get the thought out of my head though. Anyway, about 30 minutes later I got hit by a drunk driver who came off the road while I was working by the ditch. Cops caught him a few miles down the road with a missing side mirror and a smashed windshield. Dude blew a .21 and claimed he didn’t know he’d hit anything, he never hit the brakes even after hitting me so I kind of believe that honestly. Trust your gut I guess",

Thursday, I'd had a meeting with the medical team to talk about his condition and what surgery would be needed on the following Monday when he would be 1 week old.\n\nThursday late at night, I was sitting with my mum in the NICU waiting room, chatting casually while having a cuppa. Something just hit me, and I started crying and told mum I felt it in my soul that my son wasn't going to make it. She couldn't convince me he would be fine.\n\nSaturday morning, I was having a cuddle, and I noticed his breathing became more rattly, and his heart trace went a bit funny for about 15 seconds before returning to normal. The nurse and doctor gave him some medication, and by lunchtime, the nurse insisted I go get something to eat since he was doing fine. I'd just sat down with food and got a call, \"we need a parent bedside\", 5 days post-partum but I sprinted to the elevator and then to NICU where my son was in bad shape. His pulmonary veins were obstructing, and there was nothing they could do, not even the planned surgery would have prevented it even if it had been done already. I watched as his oxygen dropped and, despite all their efforts, continued to drop. We were losing him, so I told my son it was OK and that he could go. \n\nWe withdrew life support, and he passed peacefully a few hours later. I remember the feeling as we walked down to the private room, almost relief, I didn't have to keep waiting for this to happen anymore. I knew he wasn't going to come home with me alive 2 days before, even though he was doing far better than the doctors expected given his condition.\n\nWeirdly enough, before my first ultrasound, I had a feeling something was wrong. When they showed me his heart, all I thought was, \"That's why things feel wrong.\" \n\nI don't ignore my gut instinct anymore.",

We travel to a disc golfing course and just walk around, no playing. Lots of trees and growth but open for the baskets in areas, so that’s where we were walking. We could see the parking lot through the trees and suddenly another car pulls in very loudly in the gravel. To our left, dense undergrowth and a chain link fence, everything else is the course. She grabbed me like really hard and actually said she didn’t feel good about the car or something. We were the only people for about a mile but then it was just a factory and a highway. \nI said it’s ok it’s a disc golfing course dude BUT my hairs were standing straight up and she noticed. Whoever was in the car could see us, we could clearly see the windshield. It felt so so so bad. It was parked next to her car but not too close so my BEST panic plan was that we would CONFIDENTLY go to her driver door and just pile in and peel out. There weren’t on that side anyway. As we walked out, again, it was the worst feeling, like uncertainty, vulnerability, trying to poker face, be unbothered, strong, but I felt them watching. I couldn’t bear it halfway and started speeding up out of fear. She clung to me, we were walking as one girl almost when last second my mind told me to RUN GO but NOT at her car! Confusion with overwhelming fear washed over me til I saw the trail opening to the right to the first basket.\nIt is taking me a lot to get through this. Please always tell someone where you’re going. We were wild girls on an adventure and deviated from the itinerary. \nAnyway. I was on her left so I pushed her down the trail and we ran for a little bit but the trail dipped down a little and we fell down and rolled through leaves and vines until we stopped under a bush thing by a tree. It was early spring so no cover. \nGo to sit up she grabs me HARD back down and goes SHHH LOOK \nthis man was RUNNING FULL SPEED AT US. I accepted my death at that moment, she started crying, I did too, it was so quiet except this man pushing up all the dead leaves with his running and us crying softly. We couldn’t run, we both got hurt falling, we were scared so we just threw our hands up like stop please. \nHe stopped right close the bush. He obviously could see us and looked mad. We knew we were on public property, not trespassing. Without saying a word HE CRAWLS UP TO US UNDER THE BUSH AND JUST STARES AT US. So close like in our space. Then he smiled like a monster and laughed then took off walking towards the first basket, no discs on him. We ran as soon as he was slightly out of view, we didn’t have bad injuries just from falling and rolling down a hill but it wasnt optimal and he obviously began following us again. We got to her car and tumbled just like we planned, she drove and he had started running towards us again. His drivers door was open with the keys in it. \nWe actually abandoned the trip a few days later it freaked us out so bad. We kept thinking he followed us even though I STARED out the back window and he didn’t.",

Still, I went inside my work and showed my coworker the girl through the window and told her something felt off. 30 minutes later my coworker shows me a post of a local woman pleading for help because her daughter ran away from home with their dog. She attached a picture and sure enough it was the girl. The little girl was found safe and returned to her family. But still, was she in a bad home situation and maybe me talking to her would have helped or gotten her help in some way?

She was alive and healthy. Him graduating early because he’s a genius? He got expelled and dropped out. So many other things I can’t really remember but he was just a violent liar.

I slipped the clutch and slowly pulled the car about a car length ahead of the white line. The truck driver wakes up or whatever his defect was and  swerved further left into the oncoming lane and shot through the intersection at 60mph (45 limit on this road). The entire car shook and it felt like the truck missed my car by less than 2 feet. If I had stayed on the white line, he would have hit us at full speed.\nThe guy with me looked over in shock and said \"Thats the smoothest sh*t I ever saw in my life\".

I mean the time from looking up to the truck sailing through the crossing was maybe 3 seconds tops.",

My sister (~22 at the time) struggled with Bipolar 1 and major depressive/suicidal ideation for her whole life, and a severe opioid addiction for years beginning in late adolescence. Things had gotten pretty rough at one point, as my mom was constantly torn between wanting to let her see us (I would’ve been 12 at the time, my other sister around 14) while she was still alive, while also wanting to protect us from seeing what the addiction was doing to her and the family. They had a blowout fight one day and my mom went to shut off my sisters cell service so that she couldn’t have quick & easy access to call any dealers. Something in my mom’s gut told her not to - she didn’t know why, she just felt this intense inclination like she shouldn’t. My sister ended up attempting suicide by overdose in a nearby forest later that same exact night, but got scared in the final moments and called 911 on herself. That ambulance saved her life. \n\nWe lost my sister in 2022 (after years of being in recovery, but ultimately lost the battle with her depression) but I am grateful beyond words for my moms intuition that day and for the extra years it allowed us to spend with her.",

My brother who was maybe 10 pounds heavier than me climbed down next and I felt the need to spot him at the bottom. Sharp jagged shale rocks at the bottom of a waterfall behind me. The rope snapped when he was halfway down and I caught him before he hit the rocks. Probably a 15~16 foot drop at a 70 degree angle. He rolled perfectly down and I caught him with great timing and the only injury is an inch long scar on my back from a rock I fell into when I caught him. ",

            "body": "Here’s my story, still gives me chills to this day. \n\nI was in my early 20s working as a building manager at a big student centre on my university campus. This centre during the day is bustling, with a coffee shop and restaurant, booths, and meeting rooms booked. At night it’s completely empty. \n\nBut the building, for some unknown reason, is classified as a 24 hour centre. so it’s never officially locked up at night, and there’s someone at the front desk all night too. I did that job and I used to love it because I could chill and watch YouTube and study. Sweet little gig. \n\nOne night I was at the front desk alone, and I heard someone walking around the hallways. The front desk is just off the building’s atrium area, which opens up to multiple floors of the building inside. I could hear someone walking around on the different floors. I was weirded out, but didn’t feel scared - I had been warned that sometimes people  will use the building as a walkway to cut across campus late at night and get confused trying to locate an exit back out. \n\nI stepped out of the office and kind of craned my head around trying to see/hear anything else. I had a bad feeling. A few moments later an older man strolled into the office. He was very presentable, polite and clean cut, and he asked me for directions to get somewhere. I gave him the directions and the second he left I bolted myself in the office and had my partner pick me up and walk me home. I left in the middle of the shift, point blank. \n\nThe next morning campus security found a pillowcase with a butcher knife in the upper part of the student centre. I found out they also had located that same man I spoke to sleeping in the upstairs hallway of the student centre with the pillowcase.",

She told her roommate, who blamed another person who had a bit of a reputation. Marie told me what roommate said & I said, there's no way X would do that; that is NOT what she's about. However, I think your roommate stole from you. Marie rolled her eyes at me and said you just don't like her.\n\nThe bank got back to Marie in a few days and, it turned out, her roommate had forged Marie's signature on Marie's cheques and paid herself. She robbed her of about $500-$1,000 (don't remember exactly how much, but it was at that time- 1982/83). \n\nWhen Marie confronted her, roommate broke down crying and told her she's pay her back. She did before the trip and Marie moved out with another friend of ours.",

I had this incredibly bad feeling and kept asking her not to go, but she said she made a commitment. So I was like, 'Fine I'm going with' and she took me and my brother with her, at our request. She ended up working late and we all stayed the night. The next morning we're asleep and hear \"Come out of the house with your hands up.\" My brother and I go out first and there's just a ton of men in some kind of suits, like SWAT but apparently more serious, surrounding the house with their guns pointed at it. The guy my mom was helping was in some other kind of trouble, and he told her \"if there hadn't been children in the house, he wouldn't have gone out\". Knowing how his ego is, I believe this, and my mom likely would've ended up dead or in a much worse situation.\n\n2. Not mine but my mom's story. When she was a teenager she was at the mall with her friend and suddenly felt like she needed to get home immediately. They accidentally got on the wrong bus, and the urgency intensified. Eventually she got back and immediately deadbolted the door and turned off the TV. The neighbor next door had been dealing and doing hard drugs, but he was also a snitch and was having some kind of paranoid psychotic break. He began pounding on the door and yelling, and even went as far as to take an axe to it and shot at the house. My mom shot back at him, but if she hadn't been there, her own mom probably would have died that day.",

The neighborhood in Atlanta has winding roads with giant trees and she lived a massive multi-home complex surrounded by an iron gate and fence up on a hill.  When you pulled up, you went to a talk box to be called in and drive up a long a winding driveway to a flat 4-5 car garage area.  It was a Sunday afternoon and I went to visit and after a quick chat, we break up.  It’s a non-eventful breakup, just a friendly conversation, and I go to leave.  Here’s where it gets interesting, I leave the house and proceed out of the gate and take a left not thinking.  To the right of the the driveway entrance, is a 4 way stop, so I make my turn then realize I’m going down a dead end.   I turn around to head back towards the four way stop…now this is around 2002, my cell didn’t have any maps, so I get this real feeling to check my map book before I head home.  I stop my SUV about 25 feet from the line of the four way stop, quite near to the gate of the now ex-girlfriend, wondering if she’s watching me from the security cameras and get out my map book from under the seat….I roll my windows down while checking directions and the air is still and its a grey day outside. The literal second I begin to press the gas to roll up to the stop sign, BAM, a 100FT+ OAK TREE crashes across the four way stop right across the line.  It takes down all the power lines and poles blowing all the electrical and literally shaking the earth.  It was taller than my car laying on its side.  If I had not stopped short for whatever reason, I would have died that day, my car would have been directly hit even within +/-6ft of the the line.  I shook for literally 24 hours.",

Pulled the lever a few stops short - stood, but didn’t exit - neither did he. \n\nFor some context, this was right around ‘00, and I was very much in some sort of rap-rock angry kid/2gether boy band pretty boy hybrid (special K from can’t hardly wait honestly isn’t too far off from me at this point in time), so yeah had some sick ass spiked hair, the sorta-sideways adidas visor, diamond studs, a chain, fresh k swisses with ankle socks with jeans pinned up with rubber bands to show the ankle, was rocking a discman with side hanging back with those over-the-ear but behind-the-head gripping headphones (had to keep the hair fresh), had the custom Nokia out playing snake - the whole shebang. \n\nThe stop id usually exit (although a little more distance to school, it’s the stop with all the cool otw (7/11s, McDs etc..) I chose to skip and pick the next that was the shorter distance to the campus.\n\nGot off, and began walking at a brisk pace with either boys 2 men or d12 playing on the discman, don’t remember but given the time, it was one of them. Dude got off, sure enough positions himself behind me and begins closing the gap. \n\nI stop, turn around, and ask “what?”\n\nHand in pocket like some cheesy movie of NY muggings, he says “follow me over here”.\n\nI was being mugged, or an attempted to be at least. \n\nI said “I have no clue if you have a gun or not, or if willing to actually use it broad daylight in the open, but know you’ll never fucking catch me” and bolted off. \n\nAt that age, ain’t a person on the planet aside an Olympian that could catch me, yet the mother fucker tried! Chased me down a relatively busy street.. he never would have caught but I did pass a group of gentleman that could be considered intimidating looking to some (bunch MC dudes) but idgaf people are people, and yelled to them “yo this dudes fucking chasing me and claims to have a weapon!” as I sprinted past em, I briefly looked back and did see the group of dudes intervene and stop him but I still sprinted 200m dash speeds til campus.\n\nGot there just in time for PE, where I was warmed up already and enjoyed my day. \n\nA bulletin was spread later that day by the school to be extra careful and travel in buddy systems for there’s been a spike in assaults near the campus. \n\nNo clue if mine was related to that for I didn’t tell nobody but my friends and didn’t report it but yeah. \n\nFucker was trying to (at minimum) take all my shit. \n\nTl;dr idk if that counts. Instincts didn’t necessarily save me, for I still put myself in some kind of danger, but the instincts were right tho.",

I mentioned the weird vibes to my coworkers, who said he was harmless. He kept coming over to our department when he had no reason to (all women) and would interrupt work, say weird-but-tollerable things, and generally kept being odd. Until one day, one of the other girls came in for OT and he blew up at her. She'd started dating a manager for a different shift(not really encouraged, but they kept it secret to avoid issues). Shoe Guy FOLLOWED HER HOME and saw Manager's car outside her house.\n\n\nThings escalated quickly from there. He was told to stay out of our area repeatedly. Threatened to tie the other girl up with wire (we have metal wire to use in a cabinet for work reasons). Brought knives to work because he \"wanted to use our grinders to sharpen them\". Picked a fight with work grandma and then waited outside for 30+ minutes to try and catch her when she was due to leave (swing shift manager ended up walking her to her car). \n\n\nSuddenly my coworkers acknowledged I was right. He was NOT harmless. HR was not interceding. We were all varying levels of terrified to find out what he might do next.\n\n\nLuckily, for us at least, he left one of the glass furnaces on too long and melted a rather expensive piece of equipment. When his supervisor (a woman) went to talk to him about it, he started screaming threats. He got sent to HR (finally) and was told he was going to be effectively put on notice to get his shit together.\n\n\nHe did not take that well. In fact, he took it so poorly he threatened the HR lady. The cops were called. He no longer works with our company. It only took over a year and a half.\n\n\nMy coworkers have since agreed they should've listened the first time.",

I unlocked it with my card, and as soon as I walked in I had seen my buddy OD’d on the floor from a heroin overdose, luckily was able to narcan him and bring him back to consciousness. Was just a weird scary experience. I have no idea why or what was telling me to go check on the dude but I’m glad I did.",

It was my first time staying in Mandalay Bay in 2017, so I was out enjoying the amenities and local hotels every day, from my 6am workout in til late night. Then October 1st came and I did not want to leave my room. I kept telling my mom that my gut is telling me we should have a room service day. Very unlike me, I stayed in all day until my mom was finally able to convince me to go out to dinner. My gut was feeling so uneasy but I went any way. We went to Caesars Palace for dinner and I still felt uneasy until we got a drink on my way out. My Mom also started rubbing in how nothing bad happened, and that I wasted a whole day, and we laughed about it. Then as we’re walking further down the strip and closer to Mandalay Bay, we hear what I thought was fireworks, until we see a herd of people running towards us with pure fear in their eyes. \n\nIt was the Vegas Shooting. Turns out we were not just staying at the same hotel as the shooter, but our room was just down the hall on THE SAME FLOOR. We weren’t able to return to our room for the rest of the trip, but felt very blessed to be ok. Til this day my mother and I talk about my gut feeling of not wanting to leave the room at all that day.",

(one of them was a school bus so i REALLY was considering getting around that guy. because on top of the lanes merging there were also train tracks further down the road and they have to fully stop and listen)\n\ni went with my gut and was just like whatever we can wait, we have plenty of time! a few other cars pulled into the right lane and waited as well. when the light turned green all of the cars started moving forward and right in front of my eyes a car going 70 mph flew straight into the first car from the right lane. they tboned that car, making it collide with the first car in the left lane. they spun into the median and flipped onto another car. \n\ni called 911 immediately and told them that there was most likely people that are severely injured, on my way back to my house after dropping them off the intersection was completely closed which in my experience usually means there is a high chance of casualties.\n\nthere was no one in the passenger seat of the car that was hit and no one was hurt at the end of the day. the driver that hit the vehicle had a brain aneurysm that caused them to pass out at the wheel. (i checked the news later that day)\n\ni fully believe that if i would have switched into the right lane like i usually would my sister would be dead today because that would have been us getting tboned.\n\nTLDR ; randomly decided not to switch lanes at stoplight and the car who's place i would have taken was tboned by someone going 70mph",

I don't know which of my guardian angels was looking over me, but the absolute kicker was that this happened on my Mom's birthday.

Even though I avoided fatty foods. I was referred to a GI specialist and I told him it was my gallbladder but he said no. My MRI and colonoscopy was normal. My EGD did show gastritis. I was put on a gluten free diet which didn’t help. At one point he told me it was psychological! \n\nI also had pain on the left side.

He said gallbladder pain causes pain on the right side. \n\nI’m 5’5 and went from 170 to 100 pounds in about 5 (maybe less) months. Because I wouldn’t eat for 3-4 days because the pain was so bad no matter what I ate. Even if I ate plain boiled chicken and toast (no butter). The pain was unbearable and I was tired of going to the ER for only a few hours of pain relief. \n\nI went and had a scan to check my gallbladder function. My ejection fraction was normal. BUT it reproduced my pain. And GI dr still said that it must have been in my mind. \n\nI finally found a surgeon who was willing to remove it. I was prepared to get on my hands and knees and beg. He said worst case scenario would be that it wasn’t my gall bladder best case would be that it is. \n\nMy surgery took almost 3 times as long. He told my sister I had the worst gallbladder he’s ever seen in over 20 years as a surgeon. He was baffled because of my normal tests. He told my sister that my pancreas was red and inflamed and my gallbladder was even worse. He said he was so sure it was going to burst during the surgery. It was that bad. If I didn’t have surgery that day he said it likely would have burst that day or the next. \n\nHe also said the walls of my gallbladder were nothing but scar tissue from all the gallbladder attacks and it was full of sludge and sandlike material.",

My brother did what older brothers do lol\n\nGoing back to look at our security camera footage, this guy had turned on a dime the moment I’d passed him, followed me into the woods, and when he hadn’t found me there, he’d gone to his parents house (on the corner I would’ve had to start my 2 mile route on, meaning he would’ve been able to follow me there), taken their car, and had been driving around asking people if they’d seen me.\n\nWhen we called the cops on him, he told them that I’d invited him to have sex with me, and that I’d implied I’d like to be raped.

Lots of words about the race of one of the brides, and the fact that they're gay (both things he knew before allowing the wedding). Escalated to him shooting at the brides while they were running down the street trying to escape. No charges filed of course, because he's a frequent \"supporter\" of the local sheriff.",

I can normally tell by the listing picture alone.\n\nAt the beginning of every relationship I have gotten into that doesn’t work out I normally have a STRONG voice saying “this is wrong”. Sometimes I’ve still dated the person longer and have learned a lot and other times I’ve cut it off, but again, never been wrong. Sometimes it’s been with people who I have great connections and chemistry with and there’s seemingly no “red flags” but my intuition just screams.\n\nAnytime something has been wrong with my dad I’ve always known.

Her mom had to told her there was a lot of crime and to watch out for gangs. So she’s walking around with me in the baby carrier and she sees this big group of guys and they looked like they could be bad news so she sits in this cafe that was nearby and orders us lunch so we could wait them out. But those guys only stood there for like ten minutes and bounced.\n\nAll of a sudden this very attractive Caucasian couple sits next to us. The woman of the couple start chatting up my mom and tells her they are traveling Central America for their honeymoon. They struck up a conversation about what they’re plans are I these other countries and they then ask where they should visit and do while they’re in Guatemala. My mom said it was a very normal conversation for the most part. She just had a nagging feeling when they said they didn’t  have many plans in Guatemala for their 2 week stay. When we finished our food my mom gets up and says thanks for the conversation and gets up to leave. The couple thank her for being friendly and offer to buy us dessert. But my mom got the ick and was like no thank you. So we go about our day and we kept bumping into this couple. We did go to places tourists would frequent like the market but she kept getting this nagging feeling it was more than a coincidence. She still had some things to do when she spotted the lady one last time waving at her to come over. The husband nowhere in sight and she got the strongest bad feeling she says she’s ever had. She noticed the bus to our hometown was making a stop nearby decided screw it we’re going home even though she still had a bunch of stuff to get and ran to catch the bus. Then with the help of a gentleman hopped on. The gentleman told the person behind her very angrily NOT YOU and the bus driver closed the door.\n\nWhen she sat down next to the window the husband was right next to the bus staring at her very angrily. The guy that helped my mom on said the bus driver saw we were running towards them and would have just driven off if he hadn’t noticed the white guy trailing behind us trying to reach the snap of the baby carrier on her back. So he told the guy who helped us on to be ready to help my mom and not let the guy on. \n\nThis was a time when babies were being kidnapped to be put up for illegal adoptions in the States was very rampant. My mom thinks they were waiting for her to drop her guard down and snatch me. My mom was like I should have realized when they were asking her what they should do in Guatemala after telling her their plans in other countries. But glad she at least followed her gut and declined their invitation and the sudden urge to just go home later also.",

Besides, the main part was definitely accurate.\n\nAround forty years ago, she had a friend with a young son whom she would sometimes help babysit. That kid went on a trip on a plane. I think he was sent to visit some distant relatives, and the mom didn't go with. \n\nMy mom said the two of them were hanging out (kid's mom was enjoying some free time) when that lady suddenly \"heard\" her son scream for her. \n\nThey find out the plane had crashed. Timing for the incident and when that poor lady \"heard\" her son matched. \n\nStuff like this makes me think there's so much we don't know. Like, a lot of the examples here are about subconscious stimuli our brains pick up, and that makes sense. But there's also stuff our brain actually can't physically pick up, on ANY level of awareness (eg people sensing something happening to their loved ones thousands of miles away). It makes me believe in the extra-physical dimensions, like maybe we're linked by more than just oxytocin, but there's also things connecting us on a soul or spiritual level.",

            "body": "I went through a time in my life where reality seemed...warped.  Strange and inexplicable occurrences were a daily phenomenon.  Life was a constant Baader-Meinhof barrage.  I won't get into the full story, you wouldn't believe me if I told you and I wouldn't blame you, nobody I tell does.\n\nThe story I will tell happened on a nice summer day.  I was out for a run and I see one of the hills a couple km away (The city was nestled in a valley).  My gut tells me if I get there as fast as I can, something interesting will happen.  So I take off running.\n\nI get to the base of the mountain and start scrambling up a rocky face with all haste.  I'm no climber, but this was no real climbing challenge.  After making it to the top, I see there's a bunch of houses a couple hundred meters away.\n\nClose to the edge of the part that I scrambled up, there's this little concrete pad, maybe 2' x 14\", and I stand on it with my hands behind my back, like a soldier standing at attention, and close my eyes.  A minute or two later, I hear someone walking up behind me from the direction of the houses.\n\nI turn to look and there's this guy, maybe 40 or 45 years old, collared shirt and shorts, a bit disheveled.  He gets within 20 or 30 meters and sits down.  He looks distressed.\n\nI go over to him and ask him if he's ok.  He starts telling me how life has gotten weird and things are happening that don't make sense.  He talks about how he came from downtown and people were behaving strangely, acting irrationally, even trying to kill each other.  He says something about there being some kind of gate more than a few times.  All of this aligns exactly with my theories of what's happening in MY life.  I haven't had exactly the same stuff going on, but it was kind of a goal to figure out a way to find my way into that particular dimension.  That's what it felt like, another dimension, a different way for reality to order itself around you, sort of like a dream dimension.  In this case, that man seemed to be experiencing the hellish side of it.\n\nI start to question him about it.  I don't remember exactly what was said; the only part I do remember is asking him \"if we went downtown right now, would all this be going on?\". He said it would.  I ask him to show me.  So we start walking together.  We walk maybe a kilometer back down the hill; I remember at some point he goes over to one of the houses to take a drink from their outside faucet before we continue on, which I thought was odd, but whatever.  All of a sudden, a police car pulls up, and the cop gets out and tells the man, whose name was Peter, that he has to go with him.  Peter obliges and gets in the back of the cop car.  I tried to tell the cop that he hadn't done anything wrong, but was politely brushed off.\n\nI saw Peter a month or two later riding a bike, but didn't say anything to him.",

The bus driver that brought it back pointed out how powerful female intuition about it is since I was very calm about it. \n\n  \nThe other type is that some people (esp. when I was younger) can give me horrible off-vibes, and ignoring my gut for the sake of politeness has, more often than not, actually kicked my ass. I used to dislike my aunt's partners, the last one especially (I was older and more aware tbh). He turned out to be a pathological liar that ruined her life, but she wouldn't find out until many years later. \n\n  \nI generally try to trust my gut in everyday life, I think some of the things I've avoided based on gut I never actually learned I successfully avoided since there's no evidence. But overall? Trust your gut above everything else. Brain and heart are both (even combined) dumber than one's gut is.",

Found their group chat, saying bad things about me while I was treating them genuinely. Not only saying bad things, but doing it na with actions, like putting back dirty food in my plate then informing everyone not to eat it, taking photos of me unknowingly and commenting bad stuff like “saksakin ko pa yan” “mukha ba yan”, etc. this was happening for a couple of months now. So imagine being unsafe around them throughout those months?\n\nWorse is, Ive endured it for 8months. Ive lived with them and never told anyone about what I’ve seen.

It was all my fault. But I realized, if I ever hated someone, I would never do these kind of things to them. More-so to any of my friends. \n\nAlso the worst thing, (for them though) I knew how theyve talked shit about each other too. Since ive seen their chats, they talk about each other’s backs too. Lol they deserve each other.\n\nPresent: * already confronted them about it, and of course, being caught in the act, they all cried and said sorry multiple times. One even had panic attack lol. What did you feel when you were backstabbing me then? \nI felt sorry but after our last convo, one of them just said “sana satin satin na lang to, wag na ikwento pa sa iba” like girl?? Still, all you care about is yourself?? It’s not your story to tell, sooo idc 🤷‍♀️",

Shortly after the party a death threat was spray painted on his parents garage. We all talked about it but didn't take it seriously. We were more upset because the host was in trouble with his parents for having the party.\nFast forward a few years and all the news is about Jeffrey Lundgren and the Kirtland cult massacre.  Turns out the party crasher was one of the cult members and they had murdered a whole family. To this day we are all stunned that we were that close to a murderer and pissed him off. Still glad he was booted out of the party though.",

Little did we know the road to the trailhead had washed out a the week before the trip, after we planned the hikes, which added about a mile to the hike. Anyways, we made it the end of the hike, saw some great views, had lunch, and headed back down. We were walking with me in the front, one friend a few paces behind me to the left, and the third friend a few hundred feet behind us. About halfway back to the trailhead I had this fear come over me and I froze mid step. My friend right behind me kept walking but as he got next to me I instinctually shoved him backwards. I had no idea why or what even happened to me, it's like my body was acting separately from my mind. Then I saw a timber rattlesnake slither out from under the log he was about to step over, coil up, and start rattling. Once we gathered ourselves we stood there looking at the snake trying to figure out how I saw it since it was nearly indistinguishable among the dead leaves. I'm still not sure what triggered me to stop and push him away, it had to be some primal survival instinct. Needless to say our hike back was very quiet as we all thought about what would've happened if he were but. None of us had cell reception until we reached the car and drove 10 minutes away to a random intersection meaning it would've been a 40 minute hike then a 10 minute car ride just to make a 911 call. I haven't experienced something like that since.",

            "body": "I have two stories where gut instinct kind of saved my life. For minor context, I live in NYC. \n\n1) I was sneaking over to my boyfriend’s house late one night when I was 17. He lived 4 blocks away, I would spend the night and then come home before sunrise from time to time. \n\nSo I’m one and a half blocks away from his house (it’s like a T intersection and I came out from the bottom part of the T feeding into the top part going left) and this guy turns onto the street (from the right side of the T headed toward the left side of the T). \n\nNow I walked past people from time to time on these walks and never felt any kind of way about it, but for some reason when this guy and I locked eyes, every instinct I had in me told me to run. So I did. Then I look over and his motherfucker started running too. \n\nI was so scared I couldn’t scream or anything, just run. I reached the end of the T and turned right onto my boyfriend’s block (he was the last house at the end of it, so I had a bit to go) and no one was there and no lights were on in houses. I felt so much doom. I turned back to look and this guy was gaining on me. I looked forward to see how far I was from my boyfriend’s house and then, in the middle of the street, under a very bright street light, there was a man walking towards us holding a briefcase. I had not clocked him before. Neither had the man chasing me. When I saw the man under the light, I felt an immediate flood of relief and looked back and the man chasing me ran in a sort of u turn and away.\n\nAbout three weeks later I’m at my sisters house and we are eating dinner with the news on and they’re talking about a serial rapist who was caught from the streets of my area and I look up and it’s the same god damn guy. \n\nI don’t really believe in angels or religion or anything, but if I did, I would say God put an angel in the middle of that block for me. \n\n2. I was running late to meet the girl my boyfriend (from the last story) was cheating on me with to get the details of their affair and do some Christmas shopping. Two birds with one stone, you know? I’m at a red light and in front of me is a flatbed tow truck with a big Escalade on its back being towed. \n\nThe light turns green and the tow truck in front of me goes forward but everything in me tells me not to take my foot off the break. So I don’t. The car behind me gives me a toot and I don’t move and he and I make eye contact in my rear view mirror as the Escalade falls off the back of the tow truck where I would have been if I hadn’t given it the space to breathe before proceeding. \n\nWe both had a jaw drop moment, but I couldn’t stick around because I was running late, so I went around it and kept it moving. Didn’t really hit me until later that I might have saved my own life there.",

My grandma only speaks Spanish so my mom translates. My grandma told me she had a dream. There’s blue carpet and I’m with a friend with a nose like this (pushes up on the tip) and there’s a purse like this (She draws it). I knew the house and friend she was talking about. She proceeds to tell me that I go to this house and I drink a lot. I then go lay down in a bedroom and a guy comes in and tries to take advantage of me but my brother’s friend walks in and stops him. So after being told this, I slowed down my drinking and trusted her dream/gut. The house with the blue carpet was where my brother was living at the time. Years go by, my brother moves and nothing happened. \n\nAbout 10 years go by and I’m telling this story to some friends (my brothers and I have the same friends since we are all one year apart). Jared who lived with my brother at the time said, you have got to be kidding me! That happened!! He said one night his friend Carol got really drunk so he took her to his room to sleep it off. Well later he went to check on her and there was a guy in his room trying to take advantage of her. He flipped out and got my brother.",

So much stress and panic over being pinned under it or having it fall on me.\n\nSo much paranoia, got it up and on chocks, then had to move it to new site.  The driver was good, and it went in smoothly, still really iffy about the whole thing, and much anxiety.\n\nNew site is not level, the back end is 50cm or so higher than the front end, so it has to be jacked up and chocked, repatedly, with bits of old railway sleeper to hold it up.  I had one jack in place, and lifted it, and the jack popped, and began to spurt oil as the container sank down.  The jack is rated for 15 tons, the container would weight 3 at most (it's a TEU).  Thankfully I had the wood stack which stopped it after it fell 15-20cm, with a hefty crunch.\n\nIt was unstable, so with great caution, I had to lift and stabilise it with the other jack, the twin of the one that just gave on me, so it didn't fall from its rather scary angle.\n\nLessons learned NEVER get under a heavy object held up by a jack.  \n\nToday, I purchased another branded jack, (20 ton rating this time, yes, I'm paranoid now.) found I can get my money back if I drag the dodgy one and its twin into the shop (Toolpro was the dodgy brand, if anyone wants the warning). \n\nNo clue as to why I had so many fears of that container falling, no way of telling that jack would fail, but I was glad I was super cautious with it.",

TIA for reading.\n\nOn September 11th 2001 me and my parents boarded a flight to head back to the US from Poland (we'd been there for my brother's wedding.) I was 16.\n\n**Gut feeling #1**: when we left the apartment we'd been renting from family friends to head to the airport, my dad realized he left his keys at the apartment and we had to turn around to go back for them. For no explicable reason, this screamed in my head that this was a warning sign. I didn't tell my mom in the moment because I knew it would freak her out.\n\n**Gut feeling #2**: we get to the airport after having to return for the keys and it turns out that our flight to the US was delayed by several hours with no explanation. Sure, flights get delayed all the time which I understood, but again, for some reason, this translated into an alarm in my head screaming \"something is wrong.\" I still don't tell my mom I have a weird feeling.\n\n**Final realization that something was very fucking wrong**: We were about halfway across the Atlantic ocean from Poland to the US. It was the early evening. Without any type of explanation, the plane slowly starts turning around in mid-air and does a complete 180 to head back East when we should've been heading West. NO OTHER PASSENGERS SEEM TO NOTICE. NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING. I lean over to my dad and say, \"... did we just turn around? I think the plane just turned around. We're not facing the sun anymore.\" and my dad says \"We're probably just flying slower than the sunset.\" without addressing the fact that we could also literally FEEL the plane slowly turn around. No one else says anything. Nothing from the crew, OR other passengers. \n\nHours later, when we should've been preparing the land at O'Hare INTL, other passengers FINALLY start murmuring when we are close enough to the ground to see that we were DEFINITELY not in the US-- the first thing that jumped out at me was seeing a Géant supermarket by the Warsaw airport. \n\nWhen we finally deplaned is when they make the announcement that there'd been a terrorist attack in the US. We were stuck in Poland for an additional 10\\~ days before we were cleared to return home.",

I thought I might startle her to death or something, being over worried…based on nothing at all really…just my instinct. \n\nSo I ignored my feeling, I drove back home, I didn’t sleep all night, couldn’t, still worrying and worrying. \n\nThe next morning we found out grandma had had a stroke that night, she didn’t make it….if only I had listened to my instincts she might have lived….\n\nI don’t think I’ll ever forgive myself for not trusting my instincts enough, and giving a damn about how insane I’d have looked if I went in her house based on just that…",

            "body": "This was my freshman year of college, really the first couple of weeks. I was in my dorms lounge just reading a book by myself. I was the only one in there until one guy came in and sat down. The room had like a big conference table and then sofas on the wall. I was sitting in one of the sofas and if remember correctly he came and sat down next to me. He interrupted my reading but I was being polite and talked to him a bit. At first it was just a normal conversation but as it continued, he just gave me such strange vibes and I couldn’t figure out why. I kept trying to get back to my book but he would ignore my attempts and continue to talk/ask me questions. He literally sat there talking to me for like 20-25 mins before I texted my roommate and was like come get me, say we have to leave or something cause he just made me so uncomfortable. She came down and we left through one exit and came in through another to go to our room. After that I never saw him again for months, until one day, a friend I had made was said to have passed away. It was so strange cause I had literally talked that friend the day before and I was so confused. Turns out my friend knew the strange guy somehow, not sure if they were friends or not, but he got into a car with him and the guy was speeding like crazy. I don’t know if he was drunk or anything, but he was driving erratically and refused to stop. The strange guy ended up crashing the car, causing it to flip. He was somehow okay but my friend was not. My friend was still alive after the crash happened but instead of calling 911 and getting help, the strange guy got out the car and left my friend there. My friend ended up passing away but he could have survived if the guy got him help instead of running. I remember hearing about it then seeing the picture of the guy (they caught him) on the news and I was like woah wtf. I never knew what was exactly off about him but my gut told me to stay away from him and I wish I was able to relay that to my friend, cause maybe he would of still been here today. That was back in 2018/2019 and I think about that still from time to time.\n\nEdit: just looked up the article and guy was definitely intoxicated.",

This city had its own building maintenance crew of three men that did work on all the city government buildings. Even though they worked out of a different office than me, I was familiar with all of them and could call them coworkers basically.\n\nThere was one particular employee, I’ll call him J, that I encountered fairly often. He was a friendly guy and never gave me a reason to think anything was off about him. But I still had that gut feeling that something was indeed off. It’s not like I could report him to HR, as he never did or said anything untoward. But still…\n\nI was eventually laid off from that job due to budget cuts. So I wasn’t privy to the drama that unfolded after I left. But one day, several years later, I was sitting at my local bar having lunch - 40 miles away from that municipality I had previously worked for. There was the local newspaper sitting on the bar so I picked it up and started reading. And right there on the front page was a news story about J.\n\nIt turns out he and his wife had been fostering young children, and J was a pedo. The article detailed the terrible abuses he had inflicted upon 3 of his foster daughters between the ages of 12-14, and he was facing his third conviction. He won’t be getting out of prison, and I hope every waking moment has been nothing short of hell. But I just KNEW there was something off about him and never could pin point exactly why. I just made it a point to avoid him as best as possible whenever I encountered him.",

I don't know why I think that she will leave me, even though she seems really serious about our relationship; she even talks about moving in, building a family, and having our own kid, etc. But you know what? She leaves me after 1 year has passed when I start to respect myself. It is a relationship that I have a feeling will not work out entire times. Maybe it gives me solid evidence, but I choose to ignore it in that moment. That's it; this is my story about a gut feeling that saved me from a huge debt of a home.",

I got up and ran to the back door of the restaurant and turned around and my friend wasn't there so I ran back in and she was just sitting i the booth looking straight ahead.  Flames were everywhere.  I pulled her out and we ran out the back door.  A minute later there was another explosion (fuel tank).  A logging truck was coming through town which happened to be downhill and lost his brakes.  He jumped out and the truck hit a bunch of cars and came through the front of the restaurant across the table where we normally sat. There was one empty table between us and where the truck stopped.  We didn't have a scratch on us or even a shard of glass.  There was glass all over the floor which I remember vividly because I slipped in it when I went back for my friend.  The restaurant burned to the ground and 3 people died that day.   \n\n[https://frostburgfd.com/2014/02/on-this-day-in-frostburgffd-history/](https://frostburgfd.com/2014/02/on-this-day-in-frostburgffd-history/)",

            "body": "This happened to me recently, and I ignored the warning. I drive a late-night Uber, party crowds on the weekend mostly, in a small town of less than 100k.  This was 4am Saturday morning, below freezing, late January.  Thinking it may be about time to call it quits, I decide to stop in my \"usual\" piss spot, a mostly disused but patrolled parking lot off downtown. I had factored in that stopping at a usual spot might be a security issue, but it hadn't been an issue, yet. I was near the location, and decided to stop for a quick piss. As soon as I made the decision, my literal guts just all went into convulsions, almost angry/afraid, and I literally heard a voice in my head that shouted, \"Stop anywhere but there!\"  I have never had such a strong and clear gut reaction like that, but I overrode it. \"Nah, it'll be ok\" I told myself, as I pulled into the lot.  I hopped out, Uber sign on, ignition still running, 2 other cars in a lot for 100, and I parked against the header in a spot like a good citizen while I let loose. As I had done many times before. Just as I am finishing up, someone in a lifted truck came screaming down the access ramp that most ease into.  Thinking it was security coming to harass me, but also alerted, I shook off and got back in. Foot on the brake, ready to shift into gear and leave. I didn't clock that it wasn't security until he came to a screeching halt behind me, 2 feet off my bumper, blocking me in against the header.  Immediately flight or flight, and I was trapped. Thinking in my head that I was getting swamped by as many a 6 dudes (it was a crewcab), I got out of the vehicle and quartered away about 20ft, stopping to draw my pistol and wait for the attack.  There was only 1 person, he got out and came round the front of his to approach my vehicle.  He was grinning like a jackal and pretended not to see me standing there.  I demanded to know what he was doing, he was grinning like a Jackolantern at this point as he flicked his cigarette at me and stepped in my direction. Jaw grinding wildly, clearly on Meth. He was at about 25 feet when I told him not to come any closer, at which point he realized I was holding a pistol. He stops, and starts to berate my about why I have drawn a gun on him. He is very angry about this fact and screams about it, makes fun of me for it, calls into existence all manner of witnesses and cameras to see the event, even challenges me to shoot him at a certain point, after he had gone back to retrieve his gun out of his truck. This was an eternal back and forth, maybe 10 mins, and I finally got him to understand that I just wanted him to move his truck so we could both go home safely. He finally did, barely enough for me to leave, but I did. Waved down a cop on the bridge to go make contact with him. He just told me to leave, didn't really give him a story, but he pulled they guy over. I don't think anything came of it and I didn't file a report. But ignoring that feeling could have cost me my life. I have never had it so profoundly obvious, a gut feeling like that. And to literally hear a voice in my head yelling at me to \"Stop anywhere but there!\" He was waiting to ambush me, that much was clear, but for reasons unknown. It totally validated to me what I had ignored, it is real and visceral, and it knew what I didn't. It knew something that couldn't have been known. And it said it, clear as day, as if spoken by someone in the car. In my head, a voice I \"knew\" but didn't. My guts/guardian angel, intuition, whatever you want to call it literally spoke to me. I will never ignore that gut feeling again.",

At the end, they settled in a hotel where we passed the night. I had then what was the strongest hitch of instict ever felt, like some wall told me \"don't pass\".\n\nSlept, got breakfast and departed. Midway across the mountains, a landslide broke part of the road and sent tumbling down 2~4 tonne boulders. Apparently some car was hit, without dead people fortunately, and slammed out the road. Other 3 points of the road were damaged and local people told us happened during the night, when a massive thunderstorm came, rained hell and moved east.",

It was small, relatively safe community and everyone thought the robbery was a one time thing that wouldn't happen again. \n\nSo one day I am sitting in my office and I hear someone yell \"GET YOUR HANDS UP!\" I look up and a masked man has a gun pointed at the tellers. He tells them he wants to get in the vault, so they call me over as I was the only one that could open it. I open the vault and gave him all money in it. He then tries to lock us in the vault. The tellers and I wait a few minutes, then we hit the emergency release latch and go call 911. The police arrive and sweep the building and start doing their thing. \n\nA few hours go by and the FBI shows up and starts interviewing us. As they are asking us questions I get this strange thought in my head that this guy must have been a police officer, he just seemed to really know what he was doing and how to handle a gun. I had never been in a robbery before or dont know much about guns, if just \"felt\" like he was a cop. I told the FBI this, they said they would look into that, but I could tell they weren't going to. \n\nFast forward to 4 years later. I'm sitting at my desk at a different company and I get a phone call- they caught the robber and guess what- he was a cop. He worked at the local police station and responded to the first robbery I mentioned. He saw how easy it was to get away with it and he was having money problems, so he decided to give it a go. After the robbery he continued working as a police officer until he was fired and arrested for falsifying his girlfriends sobriety test. When he was arrested they took his prints and found they matched ones that were found at the robbery. They started digging into that and found out the robbery was on his day off, so there was no reason he should be there and connected him to the robbery.",

The man she was marrying was the father of their young son, and they were already living as if they were married for many months.  The wedding was pretty standard, fast forward to the reception and I'm at a table with a bunch of the coworkers and significant others.  We were getting along well and the table was vibing and the drinks were flowing.\n\nAt some point late in the reception I happen to notice the new bride over in a corner of the hall talking to some guy, and the way they were behaving seemed odd to me.  They both had this look of sadness on their faces and were having a conversation that wasn't meant to be heard by anyone else.  They were essentially talking very softly and looking around to make sure no one was within earshot.  I pointed it out to my wife and she told me that the man she was talking to was her childhood best friend.  I immediately said that the two of them were sleeping together, and had been for a long time.  My wife told me it was nonsense, and at some point it was revealed to the table what we were talking about.  Everyone at the table started observing this interaction and refused to believe that the conversation was anything but two old friends having a moment after a very emotional day.  I wrote it off, eventually the conversation moved to other things, and the day was over.\n\nWell a few years later my wife came home from work one day and was jumping out of her skin with excitement over some news she was itching to share with me.  I asked her what was up, and she proceeded to remind me of the reception where I was suspicious about the relationship between the wife and her best \"man\" friend.  Turns out I was 100% correct.  Not only was I correct about their relationship, but it turns out the son that was supposedly the product of the newlyweds was actually not the case, and the real father was the male friend.  Apparently the wife assumed the son was from the husband, which was why they married in the first place.  We didn't have all the details as it was a personal issue they were going through, but they were divorcing and the relationship was over.  \n\nOver the years I was provided with many entertaining stories involving this individual as it turned out drama was something this woman was always the center of.  She quickly married the best friend before the ink was dry on the divorce papers and that relationship also ended in divorce less than a year later.  She was in a medical career that required certification and lost that due to innapropriate relationships in the hospital she worked.  Now she is a lesbian yoga instructor, so a pretty colorful existence.  \n\nThe moral of the story fo rme is that I have a pretty good gut lol.",

He called someone (plumber I guess?) who later confirmed we had a big methane gas leak. Glad we didn't all just drift off to sleep for the last time.",

They had a lot of rules, and one way they enforced them was putting special screens on all of the windows so that the kids couldn’t sneak out (my friend never did). I was over at this friend’s house and she showed me the screens. It was a complicated child lock that was difficult to find, and mesh that was supposed to be difficult to cut through. \nFriend’s room shared a wall with their basement fireplace. My brother was a little fire bug, and the only thing going through my tiny mind was how dumb it was to be unable to escape a fire from your basement/ground level window. I sat there for 10 minutes, found the lock, figured it out, and had her practice taking out the screen and putting it back in. \n2 weeks later, the basement fireplace had some embers that lit the nearby chair on fire. It was right outside her bedroom door and blocking the stairs. She somehow didn’t wake up to the alarms. Her entire family made it out of the house and couldn’t find her. When the smoke woke her up, she took off her window screen and went to find her parents. Their entire house burned to the ground. Later that day, they asked about the window and she told them that I had taught her how to remove the screen. I came home from school to a very big box of cookies and a mom who wasn’t sure whether to hug me for helping or hit me for undermining other parents.\n\nEdit: I also knew that the “long covid” my dad got diagnosed with was cancer. The doctor wouldn’t take it seriously, and diagnosed him only after it progressed to stage 4.",

He was well dressed and groomed, but it seemed to me like he was trying too hard to be funny and charming, and his behavior became very familiar a little too quickly. They say the eyes are the windows to the soul; looking this guy in the eye as he spoke to me, I saw nothing, almost like a steel wall. It made me suspicious of him, but I couldn't articulate exactly why I didn't like him—my lizard brain was just adamant that he was not to be trusted. But my roomie was infatuated and I had no evidence to go on, so while I expressed to her that something about him was off, I didn't discourage her from seeing him. \n\nThey were off and on again for a while; half the time she loved him, half the time she hated him. Months later, she and I went out for a night with my bf; when we got back to our apartment, roomie was hammered and upset and revealed to my bf and me several hand/finger shaped bruises on her neck and arms made by this guy. She'd been concealing them with her hair and long sleeves. \n\nI wish I could say it ended there, but there was much worse trauma to follow before she finally cut him out of her life for good.",

It was a two hour appointment and on my way there I felt a sadness descend from nowhere, tears steaming down my face and with no reason why. Anyone who is used to getting tattoos will know that before an appointment you know the pain is coming so if anything you try and keep upbeat and jolly. So it was strange. Strange enough that I mentioned it to the girl that was working on me. The session passed and at the end I asked her to tattoo me a small heart on my finger - something that came from nowhere but felt like it was important. The next day at work I got the call that my dad had been found dead, a heart attack the day before. It all made sense to me. Of course then the whirlwind of family and funeral all overwhelmed me so I was out of normal life for a long time. When I went back to the tattoo shop a friend had told her about all of this - she tattooed my dads name on my other finger for me - gratis !",

Rarely have I had \"evidence\" to back it up but almost always I've been correct and later found out information that supported the gut feeling I get with these people. I can spot it just from a word, the way someone looks at me or the person they're focused on, I can pull apart stories, I can poke holes in lies, I can spot exaggeration, I can easily pick out those with a big ego that think they hold the power, and I can see straight through anyone who is faking an emotion such as happiness, fear etc. Most of the time I play along and I find it quite entertaining watching these people but when they push it too far or I want to put them in their place its very easy. People love to talk about themselves and they love to exaggerate stories, given the opportunity most will add fabricated parts to their stories. I don't know how I learned to do this and I don't recall the first time I realised it wasn't something other people were able to do, I just know that I can do it with a relatively high degree of accuracy. People who know me often call me a human lie detector. Those that like me are usually honest people, but those who dislike me generally are very dishonest people. My friends all trust my instincts and often introduce me to people just so that I can tell them wether my spidey senses are twitching. Its not a spectacular talent in usual daily life but it comes in handy sometimes",

She told me that bygones were bygones, she has forgiven me and wanted to buy me a drink. She was gonna text me the address of a bar i should meet her at. \n\nCouple things. This woman was not known to be forgiving. Especially since what i did was horrible and i wouldn’t forgiven someone. Her voice sounded….off somehow. And i could hear snickering in the background. My gut was screaming at me not to go. \n\nSo i declined. She became VERY insistent. And wouldnt let me say no. It was getting …weird. She kept asking why i said no and said repeatedly that all she wanted was to buy me a drink and talk. I ended up hanging up. The whole thing just. Didnt feel right. \n\nI found out later, through some mutual ties, that the friend i called 9-1-1 for got together with the woman i fucked over. They conspired, and the woman hired three men to beat and rape me in the back alley of that bar. The plan was to buy me a drink, then take me to the back for a smoke. Where the three men waiting would then harm me. She had actually bragged abt her plan to someone the day before, because i was “so dumb” and “bound to fall for it”. When the plan didnt work, she actually tweeted some vague stuff abt how some people deserve to be raped and it alluded to it being about me. \n\nThe friend i called 9-1-1 on ended up going around town to multiple people, telling them my darkest secrets, embellishing stories about me, and just doing everything she could to ruin my life. Ended up causing a ton of drama for several months for me. I had to cut off so many people and basically excommunicate myself and even moved back in with family bc of all the death threats and stuff i was getting. \n\nShe later apologized and tried to blame other people and gaslighted me about the entire situation. \n\nThis was years ago. That friend is still deeply troubled in such a strange way. Thankfully she was forced to move out of state\n\nShe did add my current bf on facebook the day after we got together, claimed she didnt and that he added her, then sent him several VERY WEIRD messages abt me. \n\nDeeply troubled.",

For no real reason at all besides getting a voice in his head telling him he should switch lanes, he moves over to the right most lane after already being stopped for a good 5-10 seconds. We’re now sitting in the right most lane and like 30 seconds later a small sedan comes flying up the middle lane and locks up its brakes at the start of where the crosswalk would be and skids almost all the way through the intersection. If it wasn’t for my dad getting that voice in his head we probably would have been rear ended by a car going like 50+mph.",

But this night was different. I could see the orange haze over the city and the energy (the only way I can describe it) was like pressure in a balloon that was stretched just short of popping. I felt something was coming for the city. It was extremely unsettling. The end of August came and it just kept getting hotter and the energy stronger. Then Katrina.\n\n\nI am a very logical person, I feel science and research should always be the go to for answers. Whatever connection I have with energy has always been brushed off as something more to do with me or my self talk. This could have been the same thing. ",

And we were speaking and somehow started to make out. It felt surreal, it finally happened. After that, we went downstairs to the others, eat some stuff and somehow we went back in my room and making out again, until my father came to check where I was and found me with this girl on my lap, kissing.

One day, out of nowhere, I felt this wave of anxiety wash over me—I just had this terrible pit in my stomach, and I told my dad that something bad was about to happen. \n\nFast forward a bit: my dad is working on the fridge in the camper, while my mom and I are out shopping at Bath & Body Works. Just as we’re about to check out, my mom gets a phone call, and I answer it. It’s my dad, and he speaks in a calm voice that sends chills down my spine—he needs to talk to my mom, right now. I hand her the phone, and suddenly, all hell breaks loose! She turns pale, gasps, and before I know it, she’s dropping everything and sprinting out of the store! \n\nAs we rush to the car, I catch sight of this enormous cloud of black smoke rising in the direction of our house, and panic sets in. My mom is screaming that our camper is on fire, tearing through red lights, honking like crazy—she’s totally lost it. I’m in the back seat, tears streaming down my face, overwhelmed by the chaos unfolding around me.\n\nOnce we finally make it back and the fire is out, I talk to my dad about what happened. He tells me that he was in the camper working when our German Shepherd started going wild at the door, desperate to get inside the house. My dad lets him out, thinking everything is fine, and as soon as he steps outside, he sees flames engulfing the camper. That’s when I realized my gut feeling had been spot on all along!

We started talking, it was a little wild to have such a strong feeling about her and then the timing with deleting the save and considering myself \"done\" with her. It was brief but we did rekindle a bit before we parted again.\n\nShe was also a really interesting coincidence when we first started dating, because we met in the hospital when we were both in there, and a year after meeting in that hospital, I was thinking about her as i was shopping, like kinda heart aching, thinking of messaging her, when I saw a nurse walking out of the grocery store who took care of me during that stay. I waved at her, and when I got my groceries in the car and sat down, I checked my phone. There she was, sending me the message that kicked off our relationship. \n\nI don't think that I \"will\" this stuff to happen, but I do think that I have access to the akashic record, and I think I believe in anthroposophy. I somehow have the ability to know when people are considering me. I think this type of conscious thought and associated emotions we feel towards people are tossed up into this stream of consciousness we all sorta share. And whatever identifies us, our soul I guess, can be tapped into in this stream of shared consciousness. But I also think it's sort of like breathing. You don't notice you're doing it until you start doing it on purpose. We do it intuitively. The difference being we know that we can stop or start breathing. We don't know, or don't accept rather, that we can tap into the akashic record and pick up on information flowing freely through it. I think that's why you see parallel inventions that line up at roughly the same time. Certain math concepts will be solved by two people working entirely separate of one another and their work will be similar, but also unique enough to inherently prove they couldn't have had access to the other's work.",

Apparently I ranted too much about my commission work for a few days, (new to commission work and was dealing with the drama from that one commission) and it made people feel uncomfortable and that they couldn’t use the vent tab anymore. The only one I’ve been told about before I was kicked from the discord for my “sudden change in behavior” was ranting outside the tab, but I’ve seen multiple people in the group do that before and not get removed, just reminded not to do it. Now I don’t want to trust another group that claims to be accepting and welcoming, but then kicks you out to keep the space more welcoming for being mentally ill or uninformed",

My anxiety seems to give me insanely accurate foresight with so many things. This is the biggest one. \n\nFound a small lump on my inner elbow in January and immediately shook. I knew it was cancer. So many people tried to talk me down, and I was like no this is cancer. \n\nStarted googling and looking at cancers that could be this location. Best to worst, soft tissue sarcoma to lymphoma. Before I even was able to get in to my doctor to see the lump, I was like “yep, it’ll be lymphoma.” \n\nAfter month and a half of tests, everything else was finally ruled out, I was sent to oncology and lymphoma was confirmed. I didn’t have much of reaction becuase I already went through the grievance from day one. \n\nDoing chemotherapy now!",

I was white knuckling the ‘oh shit’ handle in the passenger seat the whole ride and my dad said not to worry so much. \n\nAnd no deer jumped out, in fact I didn’t see one the whole way to the airport. He dropped me off, I told him to drive safe, and I got on the plane.\n\nSix hours later I landed and turned my phone back on and saw I had a text from my mom. My dad hit a deer on the way home and totaled the car. He was thankfully okay, but all that situation did was justify my piles of anxiety.",

The same hospital nurse calls me and tells me they want to rerun more blood tests.\n\nAdmitted into the cardiology ICU a few hours later.\n\nI was septic and started to slip into a coma that night. I woke up to alarms blaring and nurses shaking me and keeping me awake.  The next morning the hospital priest came to visit me.",

I called an ambulance and the operator advised me that it wasn't an ambulance problem and that I should wait until the next morning and bring him in to see his regular doctor.\n\nWTaF.  I have never had a emergency operator ever advise me anything close to that.  Every time I have called 000 (911 for us Australians) they have always sent an ambulance out to check things out and the only real difference between massive emergencies and not quite a massive emergency is how fast the ambulance drives to get to where I am - i.e. if the information I provide makes it sound like it is a matter of life or death then the ambulance comes speeding out with lights and sirens going but if the information I provide doesn't make it sound like a matter of life or death then the ambulance travels the speed limit.  For example, when my wife was having sudden pain shooting down her shoulder and into her back they sent out a cardio specialist ASAP while the regular ambulance made it's way over but when I called the ambulance for her contractions getting really close together the ambulance ambled it's way over and drove relatively slowly to the hospital (the road was super bumpy which made driving fast really uncomfortable for everyone involved and the contractions had slowed down a bit while the paramedics were checking her out before we left but her water had broken a few days before so they wanted her in hospital for observations).",

Day 2 he was a little red around the jawline so I told him to call first thing in the morning. His mom already agreed to take him. When I left for work it’d expanded past his neck. I received a text around 9am “they won’t see me. They said it’s normal”. I work in dentistry but I don’t like to pull that card so I called and said “it stinks”. That did the trick. He was seen, and not by his original surgeon. They said if he’d waited another 6 hours he’d be in a coma. He spent a month on what the pharmacist dubbed “the Ebola cocktail” and returning to the OS for regular lancing. They’d been trying to cut down on prescribing antibiotics around this time so he was never given any. I feel bad for not being a pushy spouse. I thought it was odd he wasn’t given amoxicillin but I’d assumed he’d gotten a prophylactic during his surgery and chalked it up to the recent cut downs. Never again.",

My friend called me after the police had got there that some guy had tried to break into her house.\n\nI knew my grandmother was going to come pick me up from my other grandparents house but they weren’t supposed to be there till about two days later. I remember pausing in what I was doing and looking at my grandmother and said “Grandma [Name] is going to pick me up tonight.” She said that she wasn’t until like Wednesday. Well later that night who rings the doorbell but my grandma from out of state. This was in the late-ish 90’s before cellphones were really common so I really had no way of communicating with her to know she was go to be there that night.\n\n\nI was out walking with my son and I got the *feeling* so I texted my friend and asked if she was in labor and she said not yet and asked if I thought it was coming. I said yes soon. Later that evening she called me and asked how I knew she was going into labor that day. I don’t know I just had that feeling.\n\nIt’s so difficult to describe. It’s like a feeling- a knowing that almost feels spiritual. Like something your soul knows before your brain does. Like a certainty that can’t be denied.",

I got into the back seat of a Geo Storm -- if you remember those, it was a tiny car made of plastic.\n\nAs soon I sat down I had a feeling of impending doom rushing over me. I had never felt that feeling before and never felt it since. I immediately was asked to be let out with some excuse and said we would catch up later. I get out and feeling quickly fades so I go on about day.\n\nAbout 2 hours later I catch up with my other friends and they immediately tell me that the two friends who came to pick me up earlier were involved in major car accident. Both were seriously hurt and in the hospital. This accident happened about 10 minutes after they tried to pick me up. They both survived.\n\nThe car did not survive though and it was struck in the passenger side rear right were I was sitting. I'm pretty positive by seeing the damage done that I would not have survived.",

I’d be working in the basement of World Trade Center, he’d go through there for his job. The night before we were going to drive out, I had a panic attack and this intense feeling of dread and was crying, telling my boyfriend that I didn’t know why I felt this way, but I didn’t feel like we should go. He was wonderful about it, didn’t question me at all, and we pivoted to move to Chicago, which was a way better fit anyway. But I was still in shock seeing those planes hit. No idea how I knew something bad was going to happen but the feeling was so strong.",

I was 16.\n\n**Gut feeling #1**: when we left the apartment we'd been renting from family friends to head to the airport, my dad realized he left his keys at the apartment and we had to turn around to go back for them. For no explicable reason, this screamed in my head that this was a warning sign. I didn't tell my mom in the moment because I knew it would freak her out.\n\n**Gut feeling #2**: we get to the airport after having to return for the keys and it turns out that our flight to the US was delayed by several hours with no explanation. Sure, flights get delayed all the time which I understood, but again, for some reason, this translated into an alarm in my head screaming \"something is wrong.\" I still don't tell my mom I have a weird feeling.\n\n**Final realization that something was very fucking wrong**: We were about halfway across the Atlantic ocean from Poland to the US. It was the early evening. Without any type of explanation, the plane slowly starts turning around in mid-air and does a complete 180 to head back East when we should've been heading West. NO OTHER PASSENGERS SEEM TO NOTICE. NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING. I lean over to my dad and say, \"... did we just turn around? I think the plane just turned around. We're not facing the sun anymore.\" and my dad says \"We're probably just flying slower than the sunset.\" without addressing the fact that we could also literally FEEL the plane slowly turn around. No one else says anything. Nothing from the crew, OR other passengers. \n\nHours later, when we should've been preparing the land at O'Hare INTL, other passengers FINALLY start murmuring when we are close enough to the ground to see that we were DEFINITELY not in the US-- the first thing that jumped out at me was seeing a Géant supermarket by the Warsaw airport. \n\nWhen we finally deplaned is when they make the announcement that there'd been a terrorist attack in the US. We were stuck in Poland for an additional 10\\~ days before we were cleared to return home.",

Our brains are so highly tuned to recognize normal and abnormal behaviour. We see it in a person's movement, their facial expressions, their tone of voice. Humans didn't survive and then thrive this successfully without becoming highly adept at reading others. \n\nIn the past I've felt like maybe I'm overreacting if I put space in between myself and an odd person in public. Last year there was a dude  in Sydney, Australia, that was mentally ill and stabbed and killed 6 random people in a shopping centre. Now I don't give a fuck, I stay highly alert and put distance between myself and weirdos.",

It's never been wrong. \n\nOne time a friend of mine started dating this dude who started working with her. The first time I met him I told my friend \"That dude is an asshole. Ditch him asap.\" My friend dismissed my claim as me being jealous(I had a crush years earlier but was well over it by then) and said he's a great dude. Well within 3 months they got an apartment together. Within 4 months, a month into living together, my friend caught the dude cheating with 3 other women, including his ex-wife that my friend didn't know he had. My friend came crying to me and I was like I fucking told you so. You gotta deal with the consequences of this one.",

I'd heard nothing but good things from the people that had met him when he came in for his interview, and was happy to have another chill person to work with. When I walked in on his first day, the second our hands met for a shake, I knew I didn't like the guy. I felt bad and kept it to myself, everyone else seemed to like him. Training him sucked because he was a huge downer about his progress even when you tried to compliment him.\n\n3 weeks into his employment, another coworker mentioned to our boss that new guy wasn't doing well. I was relieved to not be the only one to see it, but our boss brushed it off. Until new guy started getting angry and literally yelling at people if they asked him to do something well within his purview. Boss tried to sit him down and talk to him, but new guy went on the defensive and blamed the rest of us for expecting him to do his job. When our Boss later tried to give him a final warning, he rage-quit and slammed the office door open so hard, it put a hole in the wall. Security had to escort him out.",

Mick was 6'5\" and about 250 lbs of pure muscle. He was HUGE. He was also very quiet, soft spoken and there was just something \"off\" about him. The doctor was male, but the rest of the office staff was female. We ALL found him to be really scary to the point that we spoke to the doctor about it. He also felt something wasn't right, but Mick didn't actually do anything to be discharged from the practice. So, the doctor agree to do all treatments for Mick and also agreed that Mick wouldn't be scheduled at the very beginning or very end of the day, so multiple people would be in the office when Mick came in. Mick was doing a course of treatment with us and was in the office, regularly, for about 2 months. Other than him being a weird, kind of off-putting guy, there were no incidents. He was very quiet and, while gruff, he was always polite to the office staff. He finished his treatment and we never saw him again.\n\nAbout 2 years later, I was reading the paper and saw a story about an arrest of a man who raped and severely beat a woman. The person arrested? Mick, and I 100% know it was him because he had a very unique, unusual last name, the age listed was the same and there's no way there was another person named Mick [Lastname] unless it was his father and the age was wrong for that...",

Although one was a male who found out I was getting a divorce and thought that my divorce would inspire his wife to get a divorce.\n\nI will say that I have had many people tell me that I have a good instinct for people.  However - I will talk to them and ask them questions and try to find out about them - and THEN I will form an opinion.   Example - a friend brought her new bf for me to meet.   In about an hour, I found out that he had 2 baby mommas, a low paying job that he was overqualified for, was not active in the lives of either kid and made a disparaging remark about one of the baby mommas.  In my mind - that made him not a keeper.  If he will disparage an ex - he will disparage her.  Anyone who isn't involved with their kids is not a good person.  And anyone who deliberately stays in a poor paying job so they don't have to pay reasonable child support is not a good person.",

The Corps operates some parks and campgrounds directly, but on reservoirs operated by the Corps, they own the surrounding land, typically up to the elevation of the reservoir's spillway. This leads to some anomalies - e.g. in Indiana (a constitutional carry state) you can concealed carry in most state parks, but you cannot carry in state parks that are hosted on Corps of Engineers property.

There were these two women I worked with who were really close to each other but kinda unpleasant to everybody else.  They heard I was doing a reading for my friend during our lunch, and one of them approached me and asked if I could do a reading for the other one during break that afternoon.  I agreed, and break time came and they asked me to go outside and sit in a van with them to do this reading, because they didn't want anyone to see.  So I agreed to that, and we went out to the van.  I asked what her question was, and she asked if I could do the reading without her speaking a question out loud.  I told her sure, I could do that, just concentrate on your question while I shuffle the cards.  I laid out the cards and one possible interpretation of them was something unexpected and kind of a motherhood theme.  Like I said, they were rather unpleasant, and I wasn't inclined to be terribly sensitive, so I kinda laughed and said, \"what are you, pregnant?\"  My querent suddenly burst into hysterical tears and her friend explained that she missed her period and her husband had had a vasectomy.  \n\nI never found out if she really was pregnant because I got laid off the next day. :(",

And also 100 percent correct. I also knew she was pregnant despite not having seen either of them in weeks. He was dumbfounded and demanded to know how I knew, and I had to make something up because \"i just knew\" wasn't going down.\n\nSo he left for her and they had three kids in short succession. We already had two kids in their late teens who he completely cut off. (His entire family cut them off, in fact, which is fucked up).\n\nI was on a discussion forum at the time for \"skeptics\" where we talking about books and science. There was a thread where you made a joke about other user's screen names. This user i didn't know every well made a pun about my user name and I just knew I had to talk to him. Didn't know even where they were in the world, gender, anything, but it didn't matter. He moved to this country and we have been married 7.5 years. I was his first wife and he was 68 when we married. \n\nMy ex is already separated from his baby mama and my husband is the father kids always deserved. My elder kid is planning to change his last name to my husband's. I'm so much happier than I ever knew was possible.",

Detail: we didn't talk and barely knew each other. \n\nNot even 3 minutes later he left his classroom and walked down the hallway and arrived at my classroom door JUST AS I WAS IMAGINING!!! He asked to call me! \nMy heart raced! \n\nI went to him and he wanted to give me a message from the teacher who was in his class (I was the class leader and so was he). \n\nTo this day this intrigues me a lot! I don't know if it was a premonition or intuition of what would happen (as unpredictable as it was)\n\n\n#ran through google translate",

She could have died. But she was \"only\" paralyzed, couldn't talk, and had to relearn how to even swallow (let alone walk!). She was a thick-headed woman so she MOSTLY recovered, but never recovered her full independence and mobility. She trusted that doctor. I was pissed from the start. \n\n  \nIt hit me literally 2 days ago just how fucked up it was. My granny didn't actually seem 'anxious', and I'm not sure if her doctor knew about her getting abused, but the entire notion she was \"just\" anxious as an older woman (that had diabetes and was on over a dozen medications!) was just ridiculous. I never forgave that doctor, but granny continued to go to her.",

The pain was due to a complication of this condition, which had caused internal injuries. \n\n\nAs for sepsis, look out for a high temperature (though occasionally it can cause temperatures that are too low), a rapid heartbeat, and fast breathing (more than 22 breaths per minute).

She didn't even ask for the location of the pain to rule out potential appendicitis. Just \"Abdominal pain isn't an ambulance problem.\" (Funny, our health service's literal website says severe abdominal pain is an emergency and you should phone for an ambulance immediately.)\n\n\nWe formally complained and got told this was acceptable under their triage process, but never got an answer on how they'll fix this oversight, nor why the operator didn't ask me any further questions. It's terrifying thinking about how many other people might fall through cracks like this and not be so fortunate. The only thing we can think of is that at the time, we lived in a very deprived, rough area, and it was 1am. It's an unfortunate fact that people in these areas are sometimes denied services for fear of robbery or hassle, but it's no fucking excuse. The alternative is to just let people die, which is ridiculous. Many, many people in that area have no access to private transport.

Depending on what you say they'll recommend coming in to the emergency room, going to an urgent care clinic, or they can organise an out of hours visit with a GP. If what you say is alarming, they'll also send an ambulance to you if they think it's appropriate.\n\n\nWhen I phoned the ambulance the operator told me to either call 111 or wait until the morning and bring him to the GP. 111's major disadvantage is huge waiting times (sometimes hours on hold) and then I didn't know of they'd advise me to bring him in anyway. I knew something was horribly wrong and that we didn't have time for that, so I brought him to the hospital myself. I mean hell, I've used 111 successfully plenty of times, it's a good service. But I damn well knew it wasn't the appropriate one for this situation.\n\n\nIt's still insane to think my husband is alive solely because I just had a really, really bad feeling. But it's the kind of feeling you can't ignore -- I've had mild gut instincts before but this literally felt like someone was repeatedly punching me in the stomach and standing on my chest. The human subconscious is pretty incredible, and it's cool that this survival instinct can apply to the people we most care about too.",

I have an uncle who was very much like the guy, but I got the sense that my uncle only asked sensitive questions when he could tell I was struggling with something. \n\n\nWith the second guy, I wasn't a target. He molested five teen girls, he had seven daughters and a big house that was perfect for sleepovers. I was never a teen girl sleeping over at his house, so my gut had no threat to respond to. \n\n\nThe real lesson is trust your gut and judge context, not profile people and judge all actions. ",

Kept tickling her, grabbing her thigh, poking her side and tummy. He knew I was furious because he kept looking at me while he was doing it and it just seemed to egg him on. I finally said, Time for a potty break! When we got back I sat my daughter next to me and away from him. Best case scenario, he likes kids. Worst case scenario, he's a pedo. I stay the hell away from him now.",

            "body": "I would add nuance to that. There are people who have a deep and genuine desire for kids to do well. When they are around kids it is very obvious that they are invested in the kids' wellbeing, in multiple ways. You can see this with teachers, a good teacher wants kids to do well academically, a great teacher also cares about mental and emotional wellbeing. But a healthy adult has other things in their life. They get fulfillment elsewhere, they feel like normal adults other times, they function well in adult society, and they can draw boundaries and manage their behaviour. \n\nIf someone is obviously deeply invested in kids, and doesn't demonstrate seeking fulfillment elsewhere and the ability to manage themselves, that's when you worry. Those people (men and women both) often start with no explicit intent to abuse kids. But as time goes on they get to invested in the emotional wellbeing of the kids, often in teen years. Then their lack of boundaries becomes a problem. Teens asking sexual questions, talking about what is happening in their lives, growing boobs and dressing like a teen, etc. That's where you end up with the usual bullshit of \"I didn't mean to\" \"I was just showing her something\" \"all teens watch porn\" \"I thought she wanted it\" \"15 is pretty close to 16\" \"It was just a conversation\" and such. \n\nThe guy my friend was abused by was extreme. Lots of abuse is a lot less extreme, and sadly starts out in a potentially positive relationship that is not properly managed.",

She seemed genuinely happy that she found a guy who was good with kids, I'm sure she had hopes and dreams about how he'd be with their future kids. I have to believe that if she'd been more honest with herself she would have wondered about some things. In particular, why so many kids that seemed to like him suddenly wanted nothing to do with him. Why he had to keep getting fresh friends and not just be a good uncle/friend to a small group.\n\nI have no idea if she knew about the video camera, PC, VHS player and external harddrive at the hunt camp. She knew about the bed and shower, obviously, but I don't know if she knew how he used it. This was 1990s, from what I understand he was using a mix of generations of technology, 1990s grainy digital camera for stills and VHS video camera for video. There is no evidence he ever shared it. But things were different back then. No way for his wife to accidentally see a text or open tab or find a hidden file. All she knew was he was going to the hunt camp that inherited from his father. So I can't say whether or not she knew, or if she should have known.\n\nBut I'll say I have never seen a sexual abuse situation where the people close to the person had absolutely no idea. They will often admit to knowing something, but be quick to explain it away. \"oh, he was careless with leaving his computer on and we saw he liked teen porn, but we assumed it was all 18+, and we thought the comments to his younger sisters were just jokes between siblings.\" \"oh, we knew he had violence problems, but that's normal for men, it's not supposed to have consequences.\" \"we knew she was a major control freak with boundary problems, but we never thought she'd intentionally set up sexual situations for her younger siblings.\" \"we saw how those kids were afraid of their dad, but we just assumed they were religious.\" \"most teenagers have crushes on older people, we thought we'd respect his privacy.\" \"how are we supposed to raise healthy kids if a man giving sex ed is stigmatized as a predator?\" \"you're slut-shaming, she's allowed to dress like that, you can't say that she's targeting those boys. Oh, she did what? Well how was I supposed to know?\" And so on. They explain away a situation as innocent as long as possible to defend the image of the person they want to have.",

With Tweety, the budgie, I must have been driving the girl crazy because he kept flying around the cage and she kept getting the wrong blue bird.  I was 5 but was able to keep track of him so I could point him out.  Eventually, she managed to get him and he was the single coolest bird ever.  He would spend most of his time playing on the floor with me when I was home.  Or hanging out with my dad when he was working on the computer.  We still tell stories about him decades later.\n\nWith my dog, Stanley, I had given up trying to adopt a dog and was looking at breeders.  I had been looking for 2 years.  One night I went on petfinder for the hell of it and as soon as I saw his picture I knew I had to adopt him.  I put the application in immediately and the rescue told me that they had put his profile up 20 minutes before they got my application.  He had only been in foster for a week and the head of the rescue hadn't even had a chance to meet him yet lol.  When they went to leave he refused to go with them and he's been squatting at my house for the past 10 years.  He got me through some rough times and helped my dad during the end stages of cancer.  He's the best dog I've ever had and I'm so lucky I found him.  I honestly don't know what I would do without him.\n\nEdited because I hit post too soon lol.",

I worked at a school as a custodian at the time and had some friends that didn’t make good choices as well as I regularly grabbed stray dogs if I could. \n\n\nThe third dog I had talked my “friend” out of, (I will explain why in a minute), was a 5ish WEEK old puppy she decided to get. The problem? She let her Maltese she already had roam freely in an urban area, no vet or flea treatments, not neutered, and had basically already killed or lost other dogs to neglect. \n\nThis puppy was too young to be away from its mother, and she was feeding it family dollar food soaked in water, and he had so many fleas his gums were pale. Her kids never let it sleep. He was about 1lb. \n\nIt took almost a week but I talked her into letting me rehome it with a teacher before it died. Which I 100% meant to do, I had just found a great home through the special needs assistants family for a dog from this “friend” a few months prior. \n\n\nAbout 3-4 days into having the puppy home on formula and soft food, after a thorough bath with dawn and a lice comb to remove the fleas that crusted his entire little ears, he had perked up and was acting like a puppy instead of a ragdoll, and he climbed into my lap and looked at me. \n\n\nThat was it. I literally said out loud, “well shit, I’m yours aren’t I?”\n\nHe will be 12 in June. He looks like a long and short Boston terrier. DNA says he’s about 50/50 Boston and Shih Tzu. My toddler son is obsessed with him even if we have to watch them because he’s getting old and has some pains now. \n\n\nI am no longer associated with that friend.  The mistreatment of animals being the least of her flaws.",

No signs of labor and doc said \"See you on Friday for your next visit. Call if anything changes.\" I got home and my dog was like VELCRO dog. She was really restless and antsy and was practically joined to my hip the entire day, which was *really* out of character for her. She was also kind of whiny, also not like her. I thought maybe something was wrong with her, but she was eating and drinking like normal, happy to go outside and walk with me and otherwise her normal self.\n\nSo the day passed, and she continued to be clingy. Even when my husband got home from work, he was like \"What's up with the dog?\" Well, at midnight my water broke, contractions started around 2am, went to see my doc at 6am, to the hospital at 7am and my son was born at 3:30pm that afternoon.\n\nAt my six week pp appointment, I said to my doc, \"You're going to think I'm crazy, but I think my dog knew I was in labor before I did.\" She said, \"I have had SO many patients tell me that, especially the ones whose dogs are female.\" My doc said there's no conclusive evidence (obviously, this isn't something studied), but she thinks the hormones that bring on labor cause a change in scent and the dogs can \"smell\" labor on people.",

After a 5 hour wait in the er, I have kidney infection. Never had signs of uti. I have lupus, so kidney stuff is risky. This was a Thu. I do iv antibiotics, pain relief, bc by now, I’m starting to get bad back and stomach pain and sent home with a script. Saturday, they swap it. Monday, I had a scheduled appointment with my GP. He already had the hospital report. I was near septic apparently. Three different doctors tell me this, including my urologist, none of them know why I wasn’t kept. \n\nI gotta tell ya, after that iv came out and the antibiotics started hitting, I left a trail of smoke to the bathroom bc the dam finally broke. \n\nThree ERs in 3 states either failed to give me information like that or released when I shouldn’t have been. \n\nMy doctor did call to find out why I wasn’t kept. We had just got the snowbird Covid spike and they wanted my immunocompromised butt out of there asap bc they figured every staff member had been exposed. Yes, I went in with a mask. It would have been nice to be given a list of symptoms to look for to come back since sepsis can go from onset to dead pretty quick. They apparently didn’t want to scare me. \n\nI gave that same hospital a full standup routine during an early heart attack. I’m a professional patient. I don’t scare if I’m informed.",

Lab results, too, that will ping if they meet the requirements. However, many things can have these symptoms - flu is one. And flu is normally pretty poopy - have had many patients who thought they had the flu previously but most likely didn't or had a previous vaccine when they had it. This year has been pretty bad - many people came in thinking they were dying. Patients normally given fluid and/or antibiotics as a precaution, but their lab work might just reflect that this looks like flu. Blood cultures are normally taken, though - sometimes regular labwork might not show anything, but the cultures will. They normally take 2-3 days to return, and the patient will be told to come back for treatment. This seems like what happened to this person. Flu symptoms and basic labs came back \"normal\" (for flu) - possibly given precautionary treatment and no concerning comorbidities noted.

But as soon as I had that thought it was followed by, “oh, but I won’t see him again. He’s gone.” Not in a romantic way. Like my gut just told me he was *gone* gone. Forever. Dead. \n\nBut I pushed it aside, even though it kind of lingered the rest of the day. The next day I went out on the lake with my boyfriend (now fiance!) and right as we got there I got a call saying he was dead. \n\nI don’t know how I knew. We hadn’t even talked recently. It was like some external thought wiggled into my brain that he was gone. I still can’t explain that one at all.",

There's a whole other rabbit hole here one could enter, but Ill keep it short by saying I think that the human brain is far more capable than a lot of people are led to believe. People snapping awake, worried at the moment a loved one was in a car wreck. Twin telepathy.

They use \"humor\" to mask how they really feel. I realized this after feeling off about a few men and then later either saw them explode or heard about it. And they only lash out at those they see as weaker than them, children and women, in situations where they think they can get away with it. That's how you know they choose to do that and it's not just poor emotional regulation. Unfortunately my dad is like that, so I got a lot of experience with that kind of behavior and my subconscious can just pick it up before I notice. The subconscious is both a database and a processor that is excellent at recognizing patterns. Since information from the 5 senses is processed through it before being sent to the conscious mind, that's why intuition can pick up things before we know what's going on. I can tell someone's unsafe without even looking at their face. There must be something off about their body language. All my brain tells me is that I don't like that person, or this person doesn't feel trustworthy, or stay away from them. The human brain is pretty amazing. Seeing someone in person gives the best information, but photos can give some, too.",

In the 90's (while I was in college), discipleship was a major focus in lots of churches and ministries. Apparently ppl in the CoC had a very hard hold on their disciples. I was also part of the Sovereign Grace Ministries church briefly, and there were a lot of people claiming abuse there, though I never noticed it in the few months I attended. I will say that I was part of an independent \"reformed\" church and when I realized I could no longer believe the Calvinist views I was treated differently. Any dogmaticly held doctrine that someone holds up high can quickly turn into a feeling of being in a cult. That was 12 years ago for me, and I still keep a guard up against some of them. There is a \"type\" and I recognize them pretty quickly.",
