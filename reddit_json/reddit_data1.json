They align with only certain verses in Scripture, and even if they do align with those verses, they do not align with the verses when you are reading the verses in context of the passage/book.\n\nPreachers in this movement are very charismatic in speaking and performance; they persuade well too, especially if they are saying correct things about the Bible and what is coming in the ages. They might present Biblical premises and conclusions (and even points of proof). However, the logic of the points to the conclusion are unbiblical and not theologically sound. *Theology* literally means \"logic of God.\" So, even if they are using Scripture, if they are not using it as God had intended for the Church to use, then they are using the Bible un-theologically‚Äîjust like cults, and movements (e.g., Nazism).",

            "body": "I believe in Ephesians 4:11 ministry, with an apostolic role being fulfilled by those who are called to plant churches.  I think it can function on the missions field.  \n\nBut it seems like a lot of NAR folks have a very loose fuzzy idea of apostleship--- a combination of 'he's so anointed he's an apostle' and C. Peter Wagoner's idea that an apostle is someone over multiple churches.   IMO, it's adding a layer of unbiblical hierarchy on top of a layer of unbiblical or quasi-biblical hierarchy.  (Where is the 'senior pastor' in scripture?)  \n\nPaul, Silas, and Timothy had a 'measure of rule' that extended to Corinth and the Corinthians, because they had gone as far as Corinth in bringing the gospel of Christ.  They wanted help to go further into new areas, to extend their measure of rule.  Paul goes on to explain how that others who boasted in their labors were fools.  There were people who didn't introduce the Corinthians to Christ who claimed them.   Nevertheless, in his previous epistle, he seemed to include Apollos as an apostle.  Paul wrote that if the Corinthians had 10,000 teachers, but not many fathers.  An NAR interpretation was for their 'apostles' to try to gather pastors under mentors and be a daddy figure to them.  But Paul was a father in the faith to the Corinthians by evangelistically introducing them to Christ, not just by being fatherly in his interactions with them.\n\nPaul called the Corinthian church the seal of his apostleship in the Lord.  They were evidence that God had sent them.  He'd introduced the gospel to them and a new church was formed.  \n\nI've also come across the idea that a church should have a board with at least one apostle, one prophet, one evangelist, one pastor, and one teacher on it governing the church.   Why?  Ephesians 4:11 does not say that these are board member or church government roles.   \n\nApostles had a 'measure of rule' in churches started through their ministry, and the twelve were sent to the nations.   They held a leadership role in the Jerusalem church, but let others take over responsibility.  So, 'apostle' can be a church government role.  But Paul and his co-worker's measure of rule extended to where they had introduced the gospel.  He had a leadership role in Corinth and various other churches.  But in the church in Jerusalem, he listened to the advice of the elders and deferred to their counsel.  \n\nAside from the roles of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I'd say that church government roles are\n\n1.  Apostle.  \n2.  Overseer.  \n3.  Brethren.\n\nI might also mention deacon as a role of service, and administrating gifts for widows, for example, involves some administration and decision making.  \n\nIn the Old Testament, 'prophet' was not a government role over the people, though some prophets also held the role of judge or other leadership role.  David was King, for example.  But Jeremiah was not a ruler over the people in the government.  A prophet could be an overseer in the church, but he needs to meet the Biblical qualifications described in I Timothy 3 and Titus 1.  \n\n'Overseer' or bishop is used somewhat interchangeably with 'bishop.'   In Acts 20:28, Paul tells the elders of the Ephesians church to \\_pastor\\_ the church of God over which the Holy Ghost had made them overseers (bishops.)  In I Peter 5 Peter tells elders to pastor the flock of God, taking the oversight thereof.  The gift of pastor and teacher is associated with the eldership role.  But it is conceivable that someone might have this gift but not be qualified for the role, for example, due to lack of life experience, having not yet ruled his house well.\n\nHistorically, elder (priest, derived from presbuteros, translated 'elder' in the New Testament) was the go-to word for the ordained church office.  But in English and German speaking areas, the same word 'priest' was used for descendants of Aaron who ministered in the tabernacle and temple, the kohenim.  The Reformed movement in Geneva took to taking their ordained ministers 'pastors' (or linguistic equivalent) and named their city council leaders 'elders' after another Greek word translated elders 'garousia' modeling a leadership role in 3rd or 4th century Greek-speaking Christian communities in the middle east and north Africa.   This was copied and turned into a national church system by the Presbyterians, where they created the role of unordained board 'elder' and called their clergy 'pastor.'  This has been copied by other Protestant groups in the English-speaking world.\n\nIMO, while there might be some actual apostles in the NAR movement, the doctrine of apostleship is rather fuzzy in the movement, from what I've heard and read, and doesn't align that well with scripture.",

The Antioch Movement churches endorse conversion therapy ministry. \n\nNew Apostolic Reformation churches like The Antioch International Movement of Churches deviate from traditional Christian theology and practices. The movement‚Äôs emphasis on extra-biblical revelation, dominionism, and supersessionism is unbiblical and leads to a rejection of Scripture as the sole authority for Christian living. While some Christians within the NAR movement may hold to more traditional theological views, the movement as a whole has been criticized for its lack of accountability, inadequate biblical grounding, and association with questionable spiritually abusive leaders.",

They have the appearance of  Godly Christians, but there has been some very off and concerning behavior.  Quietly making false accusations, sabotaging things while totally kissing up to certain leadership, introducing certain teachings to weaker believers, but very cautious when around those of us who are mature and know our scriptures.  They are not openly pushing an agenda but are subtly trying to implement changes.  I am hoping they are just being fooled themselves and don't have a nefarious agenda, but l can't shake the feeling of concern.  However, if I say anything, the certain leader they are 'courting' will most likely accuse me of being judgmental and not loving. I am not and have not been accused of that before, but I can see the trap being set.  My husband believes (and I am  in agreement) that we need to educate ourselves about this movement, and time/God will hopefully expose them or make it clear they are just confused and need lots of grace and mercy.
