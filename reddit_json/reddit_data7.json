You can not be deeper into Trump country.\n\nAnd I just passed a decent sized protest with people holding signs about a variety of topics. DOGE, Medicare/Medicaid, Gay rights, Prices, Tariffs, etc etc...\n\nAnd some of the people looked like you'd imagine anti-trump protesters to look like.\n\nBut you know what - at least HALF of them looked exactly like you'd imagine a Trump VOTER to look like in South Carolina. \n\nIt was actually kind of uplifting in this scary moment in time.\n\nEdit: Note - any inflammatory or argumentative comments and messages will be promptly met by me going through your profile to find some common hobby or interest that we share. So that I can engage in a friendly dialogue with you.",

We were one of the stops in the underground railroad being right next to the Ohio river. Industry was great in our small city being on the river, a stop between Pittsburgh and Cincinnati, until the 60-70s when many factories began to ship their production overseas. The biggest being a Koch plant. It nearly halved the population because of how many left to find work (county pop went from 100k\\~ to almost 60k\\~). Now we're apart of the Ohio rust belt.\n\nThe 00's opioid epidemic with Oxycontin hit the area really hard. Slowly but surely the drug usage has been dropping so we're slightly on a rebound. We have many rehab facilities popping up throughout. Growing up in 2000's era of Portsmouth was hard, there wasn't shit to do in our city. But now there's a skatepark, multiple gaming lounges, coffee shops, and a \"free wall\" where you can paint graffiti without repercussions (it's currently being relocated though!).\n\nThe culture here is very, very mixed. We have a mix between southern, midwestern, and Appalachian influences. A good amount of youth here are blue but the elderly, which there are more of, are red. I lived here all my life and am proud of what my town is trying to do.\n\nOne last fun fact: before they were the Detroit Lions, they were called the Portsmouth Spartans, we sold our NFL franchise in the 30s.\n\nIf you have any questions about Portsmouth, feel free to ask!",

            "body": "Let‚Äôs talk about the tariffs and the effects it has on the manufacturers of this country. \n\nAssume for a minute that you wanted to bring back some manufacturing to the USA, which of course is a huge assumption compared to manufacturing outside the country like we do as a company. \n\nWhich I will get to in just a moment. \nThis week alone the stock market lost over US$9 trillion which means every single manufacturer that has a US corporation is part of that loss. Which goes to show you that Trump‚Äòs logic is about as efficient as his spray tan. \n\nIf these companies even had a thought of coming back to the United States, all of their cash has now evaporated because of the loss in the stock market so who‚Äôs going to finance these new manufacturing plants that Trump keeps talking about, that are going to come back here make the economy great? \n\nNow goods have gone up in price in some cases doubled already this week which means the consumers are going to be buying less. Companies are going to begin layoffs, because they‚Äôve lost a huge portion of their cash reserves. Their businesses are going to be diminished some because of the lower purchasing rate and the higher pricing. \n\nBringing manufacturing back to the United States at this point with this approach has been almost completely eliminated. \n\nAll you have to do is go back and look at what happened during the depression when they tried to institute tariffs causing the depression to take even a further nose dive and adding years into the depressive point. It‚Äôs such a joke that they used it in the movie Ferris Bueller‚Äòs Day off where the teacher was talking about how bad tariffs are and how they caused the depression to go down, which goes to show you that if they use it as a punchline, then it obviously cannot work. \n\nWith our business, we were building some manufacturing plants in the United States and now have had to put it on hold because of the tariffs. As an example, each of our production lines has a manufacturing cost of a little under US$5 million, we did try to price it in the United States but we found quotes anywhere from $12-$16 million for the same exact production line that we are having made in China. So we couldn‚Äôt make the equipment in the United States, but we were going to import it and set up manufacturing plants. \n\nOne of them was in Arkansas where the state is somewhat depressed. Now we have put that project on hold with approximately 1800 people we were going to hire. \n\nThe reason for that is not just the tariffs, from the equipment if you think about it a piece of equipment that cost me $5 million is now going to cost me about $9 million. Each production line generates about US$35 million of revenue so it‚Äôs not just a tariff in my situation it‚Äôs the fact that for $9 million I can have practically two production lines generating $70 million of income compared to the same $9 million generating $35 million worth of income, with a much lower profit margin because of the labor cost in the United States along with all the taxes and liability issues that you carry because of the litigious nature of the United States operating. \n\nSo tariffs do not work, they hurt the economy. The only thing that they do on the surface is generate more tax dollars for the US government, but they diminish and wipe out the middle and lower class. \n\nDo you want to bring manufacturing back to the United States? \n\nYou‚Äôve got to do something about all of the litigious actions,  you have to lower healthcare cost, lower pharmaceutical cost, have to educate more so that children can grow up and learn trades. \n\nYou have to find ways to lower the cost of living and once you start doing that then laboring jobs will become available again. \n\nThe next problem is the taxation situation is off-balance. We have structured our tax code so that the wealthy and the publicly traded companies that offer stock options instead of salaries, which is taxable make it almost impossible to collect tax. \n\nTake Musk for an example from Tesla. \n\nThey talk about his $300 billion worth but it‚Äôs all in stock and that‚Äôs unrealized gains paying no taxes. What he does is he goes to the bank and he borrows money against that stock portfolio, borrowed money is non-taxable income and then he uses that money to live and buy things like he bought Twitter for $44 billion with borrowed money,  no taxes paid at all. \n\nAnd then what he does from there to pay off those loans is he borrows against other portfolios and he just keeps borrowing deferring the taxes. \n\n$300 billion and no taxes paid whereas the employees that work for all those companies have taxes taken out of each paycheck. \n\nJust look salaries up of the top executives around the country and you look at their income, you‚Äôll see that their salaries are generally between one hundred and two hundred thousand US dollars but they earned anywhere from ten to a hundred million dollars a year all in stock options and then they keep those options in stock and then borrow against them so their tax base is almost nothing. \n\nyou want to fix the economy. You have to find a way to tax the rich, you‚Äôre not going to make them poor, you‚Äôre just going to make them help to strengthen the economy.\n\nI almost forgot, tariffs funds go directly to the administration for spending (trump and his team), whereas taxes go through congress for spending.",

He removed the tax for us, so we do not pay federal income tax us slaves anymore,  but he is looking for the way to power the gov, and tariffs is what he is believing in...   i love the idea of no fed tax on my check,  I don't know about all of you,  but sure sounds great to me,  let the rich pay for my medicare,  while he cuts their tax,  our Laws, require the tax to be the same for everyone, no one special.  But right now, until this country goes back to work,  and the housing is affordable,  He has to do something to make it happen,  To me,  He is doing just fine,  except to refund the ssa from the Biden who stolen from it,  and there are many of his kind of gangsters in our gov....",

So it's pretty much a perfect example of Americans not really doing anything about the miserable state of their country and just giving up. All these Americans here keep saying it's just *\"the media not covering it*\", well probably because a camera crew would have just about as many people. And for a city that big it's not really a story.\n\nHell, I'm from a town in Alberta with a population of just over 3,000 and we had more people protesting during the postal workers strike. So by any margin this is pathetic. \n\nOh, but hey, it's a Saturday, so just like Trump they probably didn't want to miss golf.",

That's the functional equivalent of a protest in London or Paris of like 100,000 people.  \n\nIt's also deep red country.  A dying river port town at the confluence of the Ohio and Scioto rivers that's exactly the kind of post-industrial rust belt type of place where Trumpism has taken over.  \n\nIt's exactly the type of place you'd expect a pro-tariff demonstration to be happening right now.",

And then, take a minute, and google protest movements  and see what their outcomes have been. \n\nToday in the USA there are more than 1,000 protests against Trump and Elon Musk planned in cities across all 50 states, with several international cities taking part, marking the first major demonstration against Trump in his second term. We are not talking about one small town but rather a nationwide movement. \n\nThis is the first step of many which are effective,\npeaceful and patient ways to utilize protests to influence those in positions of power like state representatives, governors, congressional representatives and senators.",

That should be an absolutely easy political win for the Republican party - \"We are not corrupt and going to hold [the fall guy] accountable for the security compromise!\" Kick him out, then they and Trump could just proceed to install another Fox News idiot as the replacement. But at least to the public, it would look like the Republicans are doing their job of checks and balances.\n\nInstead? Silence. And it's been especially interesting because even though Trump is denying it happened and 'fake news', none of the Republican senators are denying that it happened. They are just keeping their mouths shut even when they know what happened was wrong.\n\nThat's just weak. Do your damn job, especially when it's an action that wouldn't even hurt you or your party.",

First, we have a multi-party system and people tend to actually change which party they vote for from election to election, it's not as black and white as in the US. Strict party affiliation is rare. Second, \"conservative\" means something entirely different here than it does in the US -- if you remember Merkel, she was actually leader of the biggest conservative party here (but they are not the only ones and AfD likes to stylize themselves as conservative too, even though they are not -- they're extreme right-wing, which is different). But to answer your question, towns in general tend to be more conservative (and more likely to vote extreme right-wing) than cities here.\n\nThere are two cities right next to us actually. One is 15 minutes away by car or train, but they are a separate county and have their own representatives, different from ours. The other one is like 20 minutes away by car and is quite a bit smaller than the other city (actually, I think they recently lost their \"major city\" status because people are moving away), but it is the one we belong to. It's also way more conservative than the other city, which primarily votes greens.",

It didn‚Äôt change anything in a material sense.\n\nBut it did matter a lot in a symbolic sense. Making a speech for 25 full hours shows that democrats know what is happening, they disapprove, and they are willing to make great personal sacrifices to tell people that and to show solidarity. That matters.\n\nIn order to win, Democrats need to massively shift Americans‚Äô views of them. This is a way for them to start doing that. A lot of Americans are too apathetic or too stupid to understand how important politics are, and that the Democrats are the better choice. An emotional gesture like this will grab those people and make them understand.",

Even within the Ohio, the city of Portsmouth is only 0.14% of the state population so that's still a small town. \n\nOne should really think about the U.S. as more like the European Union and the individual states as a country.

The Republicans to their credit were very effective in building from the ground up in that manner, and now the Democrats have to start doing the same. \n\nEven in California as a heavy majority Democrat state, they still have 9 Republicans voted to the House of Representatives. Those seats matter since there is currently only a 7 person split between Democrats and Republicans in the HOR. That's an example of where the Democrat party should focus their efforts, start getting little wins in a region where they are already the majority and it will add up over time just as the Republicans have been doing since the Obama administration.",

She opposed Kavanaugh's SCOTUS nomination in 2018 and supported Ketanji Brown Jackson's SCOTUS nomination in 2022.

Like for example, if Buttigieg was an elected member, he could be focused on criticizing everything Duffy is doing, and he'd have his experience doing the same job to help inform him. But instead, he's probably going to be doing basically nothing for the next 4 years, and then pop up again just in time for the next presidential primaries.

What do you want to happen, reverse the election and install Kamala Harris? \n\nRequests for change must be clear and unambiguous, and be logically consistent. The proposed remedy must actually address the cited problem. Or else it comes across as gaslighting and diversion. In negotiation you must make a clearly defined request to your counterparty, that they can look at, analyze, make a counteroffer to and ask you what you are offering in return. \n\nI think the problem lies in that for the past 30 years or so the Left has not had to negotiate. With a lapdog establishment media and full control of nearly every institution they just demanded, and then stomped their feet and broke windows until they got what they wanted. No more, and those days are never coming back. You are going to have to learn to negotiate and act in good faith, to give in order to get, and to recognize that differences of opinion and perspective are earnest and legitimate- in other words- that the old conservative guy might know what he's talking about, and isn't just trying to poison all the air and water and kill all the minorities and homosexuals.

Which protest did he lead that advocated violence against Israeli students?\n\n> Siri‚Äôs father in law is a member of Hamas\n\nSiri has no control over that. What did Siri actually do? He exercised free speech in a way Trump didn‚Äôt like. That‚Äôs it. Unless there is something else?\n\nYou‚Äôre just cheering on the arrest of people because they said things you don‚Äôt like. I don‚Äôt think you should be arrested for saying things I don‚Äôt like. But I guess that‚Äôs just because folks like me care about free speech and you do not.",
