Perform multiclass sentiment analysis on the following comments.
Identify exactly 8 present emotions from the given categories, considering tone and context.

**YOU MUST SELECT EMOTIONS ONLY FROM THIS EXACT LIST. DO NOT CREATE OR GUESS NEW EMOTIONS.**  
**Allowed Emotions (STRICTLY ONE-WORD ONLY):**
"Agreement", "Aggression", "Amusement", "Anger", "Annoyance", "Anticipation", "Anxiety", "Apology",
"Approval", "Caring", "Confidence", "Contempt", "Confusion", "Curiosity", "Defiance", "Disappointment",
"Disbelief", "Disgust", "Disapproval","Disagreement", "Encouragement", "Excitement", "Fear", "Frustration", "Gratitude", "Hope",
"Love", "Joy", "Neutral", "Pride", "Resignation", "Resilience", "Sarcasm", "Sadness", "Skepticism", "Support",
and "Surprise".

---

### **Instructions:**
- **Select exactly 8 emotions. NO MORE, NO LESS.**
- **STRICTLY PICK FROM THE LIST ABOVE. DO NOT INVENT NEW EMOTIONS.**
- **Do NOT assign emotions randomly.** Analyze tone and sarcasm carefully.
- **Do NOT reuse emotions**
- **Aggressive language does NOT mean hostility.** Recognize when it is supportive.
- **Always detect supportive and encouraging emotions** when applicable.
- **If a match is unclear, choose the closest equivalent from the list.**
- **Do not choose neutral unless absolutely necessary.**
- **Do NOT ASSIGN neutral if a comment already has 5 categories.**
- **DO NOT ADD EXPLANATIONS OR EXTRA WORDS. ONLY RETURN THE EMOTION ARRAY.**
- **DO NOT ADD EMOTIONS THAT ARE NOT IN THE LIST. CHOOSE THE CLOSEST EQUIVALENT FROM THE LIST.**
